## K P Abraham Memorial Fund

An Appeal to Alumni and well wishers

The Indian Institute of Science and the Department of Materials Engineering announce the launch of the KP Abraham Memorial Fund. We aim to generate a corpus of at least Rs. 2 crores that will serve the twin objectives of partially equipping laboratories in our new building and of endowing a visiting faculty chair.

Professor Kadavil Poulose Abraham (1920-2011) served the department for  21 years, including the period 1972-1977 when he was the fourth Head of the Department. As a teacher, Professor Abraham inspired many generations of students through his lectures on thermodynamics and extractive metallurgy. His teaching covered both iron & steel and nonferrous metals. He helped establish laboratories in Process Metallurgy, some of which were pioneering in the Indian scene.  When that generation of alumni reflects on the solidity of the fundamentals with which they left IISc, it is in large part a testimony to the academic excellence that Professor Abraham nurtured. His students went on to become leading metallurgists and materials scientists, both, in academic institutions as well as in industry, in India and abroad. In launching this appeal, the Institute and the department, where he spent the major part of his working life, would like to pay tribute to his accomplishments in laying the foundations for what has now become a vibrant centre for teaching and research in the field of materials in India.

The present appeal follows our earlier tribute to Professor Brahm Prakash, the first Indian Head of the Department, which saw the establishment of the Prof Brahm Prakash Visiting Chair and Prof Brahm Prakash Laboratory by generating resources of the order of Rs 1 crore from Government institutions, alumni, and well wishers, nearly 2 decades ago.

The department has just commenced the construction of a 4-storeyed building which will house about 2500 square metres of laboratories, classrooms and offices to accommodate our expanding needs that arise from a research student strength that now exceeds 110, a new Undergraduate programme, in addition to the traditional Masters and in the diversification of our research interests to include electronic materials, polymers and bio-engineering. The KP Abraham Chair Professorship will add to existing chairs to enable distinguished scientists to spend significant periods of time at IISc.

We invite alumni and well-wishers to contribute generously to the fund (Contributions received so far Rs.70.20 Lakhs, for details Click here). Cheques may be drawn in favour of Registrar, Indian Institute of Science – KP Abraham Memorial Fund. Donations from Indian citizens will attract Tax relief to the extent of 100% of the donation without limit under section  35(i)(ii) OR sec 80G(2)(a)(iiif). Wire transfer details are given below:

## Manish Memorial Endowment Fund

History<br>

Manish Memorial Endowment Fund was initiated in the name of Mr. Manish Narayan with the objective of providing a young research scholar from the Department of Materials Engineering (formerly Metallurgy), IISc, international research exposure by supporting him/her to attend an international conference for presenting a paper.

Manish Narayan was an M.E (I) student from the Department of Metallurgy, IISc, between 1989 – 1993. His field of interest was Composites and he did his final ME project with Prof M.K. Surappa. After his graduation he had a short stint with Titan Industries, where he worked on the ‘Tanishq’ range of jewellery watches. He then went to pursue a Doctorate in NJIT & later on shifted to Lehigh. His promising academic career came to an end, when he passed away in a tragic car accident at Tennessee, USA on July 29th 1996 on his way back from Atlanta Olympics.

In the IT / communication era, with monetarily attractive software jobs all around, there were not even 15% graduates from the Department of Metallurgy who went on to pursue their career in Metallurgy. But Manish was one among those 15%.

Many of his batchmates came together to institute a fund in his name at the Department of Metallurgy, IISc, to cherish his memory and also to promote a strong research culture among students working in this area.

All students of the Department of Metallurgy are encouraged to apply for this award.

### Selection Procedure

The award is open to all academic students of the Department of Materials Engineering.
The canditate should have the paper authored or co-authored by him/her accepted in a  conference / workshop / symposium / seminar.  Preference is to be given to international events.<br>

Selection Criteria: The following criteria may be followed for the selection – Merit, Standard of the conference and Need.
The amount of the standard award is decided by the Department from time to time. At present it stands at a maximum of Rs. 25,000. The award can be shared by more than one person, in which case, the amount of the award may be decided by the selecting authority.
A student is normally eligible to receive this award only once during their tenure at IISc.

### Renewed Appeal

Dear Friends,

Nearly 2 decades ago, the 1989-93 batch of M.E .(Integrated) seeded the Manish Narayan Fund (MNF) at Department of Metallurgy (now Materials Engineering) at IISc in memory of Manish. Theirs was a far-sighted and touching gesture whose implications could not have been realized at that time. Because this fund has now grown into a corpus of about 30 lakhs, thanks to subsequent donations from alumni and other funds generated through the Institute.

In the early years of this endowment, the fund was small and the number of awards given annually were less than 2; sometimes none. Fast forward to today and we now disburse Rs. 25000 ($ 400) to about 10-11 students, annually, from the interest received on this corpus, to help them travel and present talks at international conferences. Where do we want to be in future? That is why I am writing to you now to appeal to your generosity once again.

Our department now has 110 Ph.D. students, for whom, exposure to international conferences is no longer a luxury but an integral part of their training. It builds confidence, makes them realize where the cutting edge of their field is and helps them to network with professionals. In many instances, such visits help with identifying job opportunities. I believe that each student should attend a major meeting at least once in their tenure at IISc and that MNF should give them a seed grant that is sufficient for them to approach other funding agencies: this means quadrupling our corpus from 30 lakhs to at least 1.2 crores.

As part of the recently held Global Alumni Conference of IISc, I had the pleasure of meeting Krishna Kummamuru and discussing the prospect of a renewed appeal. I am delighted to report that he and his friends were enthusiastic in their support and that we have, in fact, had an immediate response from Sankaranarayanan Balasubramanian who has announced his contribution of Rs. 2.4 lakhs. Details of how you can donate are given in the following page.

In urging you to contribute to the best of your ability, I am really asking you to keep Manish’s memory alive in a cause that will help our students cope with this increasingly inter-linked and globalised world.

Do not hesitate to write if you need any more information.

With best wishes from all of us here at Materials Engineering,
Yours sincerely,
Abinandanan TA

### What others say about Manish?

Manish, We always remember you….

He turned out to be the most likable guy I have ever met. – Sanjeev 

" If I could recollect the exact day, it was July the 28th, 1989 that I first happened to meet this guy, Manish Narayan. It was my first day at I.I.Sc. We were supposed to assemble at the TATA INSTITUTE main lobby near the Main Entrance by 8.00 AM and I was late by about an hour. The hall was Jam-packed and the Chairman had completed his introductory speech by then. I felt nervous when a section of the audience turned back and starred at me for being late. The function was nearly getting over when I noticed a guy walking into the hall through the rear entrance. He immediately caught my attention. A typical Bangalorian guy, wearing a leather Jacket and a goggles. I had never been to bangalore before but had heard that most of the guys in Bangalore were typically a freak-out character.

After the function, I never had a chance to meet this guy for some days. I did not see him in the hostel during the ragging sessions when the seniors were terrorizing us. Being a localite, I presume, he avoided staying at the hostel during the ragging sessions. I dont recollect seeing him at Metallurgy department during that time. Only after a couple of weeks I started hearing about Manish Narayan. The seniors judged him as one of the few pleasing guys who joined along with me. Probably he covered the seniors with his innocent looks and smile. He had tremendous sense of humor. He spoke Tamil quite differently from us (Kannada mixed Tamil) and this made him the center of attraction during any discussion. He ability to communicate fluently in Hindi, Kannada (only person to speak Kannada in our class) and ofcourse English, landed him in trouble. He would be the guy to enter the Professors room first when the students decide to get the Prof.s permission to postpone an exam or cancel a class. I swear, we have been quite successful in those and the credit obviously goes to Manish. Most of us do the planning behind the scene, but when it comes to performing the act, he would lead us through.

Manish was the only student in my class who pursued an academic career after a short stint with Titan Watches. A brilliant chap who gave his best in anything he did. I was in touch with him when he came to States for his doctorate. He had a couple of publications under his belt and I am quite sure, a few more were due. I used to make fun of him saying that he would surely be finding his academic life pretty tough for not being able to cope up with the research-pressure, but inside me I was knew that with his brilliance, he would come out with flying colors. And he did! He shifted to Lehigh for his doctorate.
Coming to my personal experiences, he was always the target when I return home for holidays. I would seek his help in getting some quality sweets from Shivaji Nagar. He had that old TVS-50 (his friends use it more often than him) on which he would take me to shop around for sweets. He never refused to come with me. All he would ask in return is a glass of Badam Milk. I soon realized that he was becoming close to everyone in the whole batch. Any Video session or any trips around Bangalore, Manish would be the target. As an Organizer, he did a great job. The trips we made to Mercara, Ooty and Kemmangundi are still in our minds. It makes me laugh even now when I see those snaps taken during those trips. Manish, with his long dark-blue shorts under the waterfalls, cannot be easily forgotten.

Recalling the Sports we played at I.I.Sc, Manish was not a good athlete, but was always part of any team we formed. Who can forget those Tennis-Ball tournaments at I.I.Sc., where some of us, who were left out from the mainstream formed a Cricket team. I swear, we did not perform badly, but were repeatedly knocked out after the league matches (quite obvious). We had guys in our team, who found it difficult to complete his over after the ball failed to go to the stumps but preferred the direction of the leg-umpire. Manish was one of the striking bowler and a middle order batsman for the team. Though he didnt score many runs, it was a real fun. He was also part of the Volleyball team which we played.
Though not in the first 6, he encouraged us from the bench. During a match, when he was in the bench, he had to be carried away to the Health Center after he got excited, made a jump and sprained his ankle. I later come to know that he kept telling guys (who did not watch that match) that he has sprained his ankle while trying to volley a shot. Clever chap but unfortunately could not keep it a secret for that long.

He contested for the post of Vice-President during our second year. Not that he was very keen to win but had to accept it because of the compulsion of some of the guys who also contested for different posts. These guys were obviously relying on him for their victory because Manish had a wide range of contacts in the institute. The sad part is that, each of them lost their deposit including Manish, probably because no one took him seriously when he contested. I am sure, with his leadership qualities, he would have performed very well if he had won that election.

His parents gave us the best hospitality we could ever imagine by repeatedly inviting us home. We had a good time at his place. Those delicious home-cooked food cant be easily forgotten. Its really sad that he isnt with us anymore. I just find it difficult to believe that! His memories would remain in our minds for ever.

Thinking back, I realize how I had mis-judged the guy who entered the hall (on my first day at I.I.Sc) with a freaky outfit. He turned out to be the most likable guy I have ever met."

Sanjeev

He was one of the nicest persons I’ve ever known. – KKV 

"He was one of the nicest persons I've ever known. Cheerful and always willing to give a helping hand at any point in time, he had this uncanny knack of winning over people with his disarming smile and pleasant demeanour. We had some of the best times together - all those trips as a big, noisy group to Mercara (jampacked in a van!), then to Kemmangundi (where we slept in some decrepit bungalow) and later to Ooty which was so impulsive as we just decided to leave one Friday night. Manish, being the localite was always forced to be the organiser - and he sure did a great job. Then ofcourse all the day-to-day activities we shared : the numerous movies, dinners at C-mess, the gossip at PD-Block reading room - the list is endless. The hospitality he used to display at his Jayanagar residence, proved a haven for all those craving for some delicious home food. Surely, his parents did not deserve this cruel blow for being the sweetest people around."
