The Department of Materials Engineering offers research programs leading to PhD and MSc(Engg) degrees, and a masters level course program leading to an ME degree. In addition, along with the Materials Research Centre, it runs the Materials Stream in the Institute's undergraduate program.

In all, the Department has over 100 PhD scholars, and over 40 ME students during 2020-22. The Materials stream in the UG program has 12 students in the Class of 2019 and 19 in the Class of 2020.

The Department also hosts a fairly large number of post-graduate students and research scholars who visit us under the UGC-funded Networking Resource Centre for Materials (NRC-M) program. In addition, it also hosts a number of undergraduate and post-graduate students as summer interns.
