### Prof Brahm Prakash Chair
Brahm Prakash was born on 21 August 1912 at Lahore. He obtained his B.Sc.(Hons.) degree in 1932, M.Sc. in 1934 and Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1942 from the Punjab University. Subsequently, he obtained his Sc.D. in Metallurgy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.A in 1949. After returning to India he served at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore from 1951 to 1957, at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay from 1957-1972 and at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Trivandrum from 1972 to 1982. While the tasks at these institutions called for different skills, they all posed challenges of a high order. Dr. Prakash discharged them with distinction and has left a rich legacy of scientific and administrative leadership.

At the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Professor Brahm Prakash was the first Indian Head of the Department of Metallurgy. He laid the foundations for an excellent centre for metallurgical education and research in the country.

In order to commemorate the services of Professor Prakash, the community of metallurgists and materials scientists and technologists has taken several steps:

A Professor Brahm Prakash Chair has been endowed at the Indian Institute of Science.
A Professor Brahm Prakash Medal has been instituted at the Department of Metallurgy to be awarded to the best graduate student.
A memorial lecture series has been arranged since 1985 by the Bangalore Chapter of IIM. The Trivandrum Chapter of IIM has also instituted a similar lecture series.
The Kalpakkam Chapter of IIM conducts the Prof. Brahm Prakash Materials Quiz for school students (12th standard).
The Indian National Science Academy (INSA) has instituted the Prof. Brahm Prakash Medal to be awarded for significant contributions in the area of materials science and engneering.

### Prof R R Tummala Grant
Prof. R. R. Tummala, Pettit Professor in Electronic Packaging, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA, who was the Brahm Prakash Visiting Professor, expressed his desire to institute Professor R. R. Tummala Fund under the terms and conditions as given below. He has also made a contribution of US $2,500/- through Bank of America cheque as well as a cash donation of Rs.67,531/-.

From the financial contribution made by Prof. R. R. Tummala, Distinguish Alumnus Awardee (1997) of the Indian Institute of Science, a fund will be established at IISc and operated by the Chairman, Department of Metallurgy, IISc.
The objective of this fund is to foster research in electronic materials at IISc via student visits to the Georgia Institute of Technology at Atlanta, USA. This will lead to archival publications with co-authorship between the two institutions.
The interest from the fund will be utilized for a partial travel grant to the student. It is expected that the remaining cost of the travel will be raised through the resources of the Department/IISc/Government of India.
The student is expected to spend 3 to 6 months in the USA. Living expenses in the USA will be from the resources at the US end.
The selection of the students will be done by a Committee of 3 Professors with the Chairman of the Department as the Chairman of the Committee. The final name will be announced under intimation to Prof. Tummala.
The terms and conditions of the operation of this fund will be reviewed every three years and may be suitably modified after mutual consultations.

### Prof R M Mallya Processing Award
Dr S C Deevi, an alumnus of our Dept , gave a donation of $ 1000 in 1991 and desired that an Annual Award be instituted in the name of Prof R M Mallya, his research supervisor and given in the area of Materials Processing.
