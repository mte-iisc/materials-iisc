## Prof. Brahm Prakash Chair
Brahm Prakash was born on 21 August 1912 at Lahore. He obtained his B.Sc.(Hons.) degree in 1932, M.Sc. in 1934 and Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1942 from the Punjab University. Subsequently, he obtained his Sc.D. in Metallurgy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.A in 1949. After returning to India he served at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore from 1951 to 1957, at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay from 1957-1972 and at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Trivandrum from 1972 to 1982. While the tasks at these institutions called for different skills, they all posed challenges of a high order. Dr. Prakash discharged them with distinction and has left a rich legacy of scientific and administrative leadership.

At the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Professor Brahm Prakash was the first Indian Head of the Department of Metallurgy. He laid the foundations for an excellent centre for metallurgical education and research in the country.

In order to commemorate the services of Professor Prakash, the community of metallurgists and materials scientists and technologists has taken several steps:
<ul>
<li>A Professor Brahm Prakash Chair has been endowed at the Indian Institute of Science.</li>
<li>A Professor Brahm Prakash Medal has been instituted at the Department of Metallurgy to be awarded to the best graduate student.</li>
<li>A memorial lecture series has been arranged since 1985 by the Bangalore Chapter of IIM. The Trivandrum Chapter of IIM has also instituted a similar lecture series.</li>
<li>The Kalpakkam Chapter of IIM conducts the Prof. Brahm Prakash Materials Quiz for school students (12th standard).</li>
<li>The Indian National Science Academy (INSA) has instituted the Prof. Brahm Prakash Medal to be awarded for significant contributions in the area of materials science and engneering.</li>
</ul>

## Manish Narayan Memorial Endowment Fund

### History

Manish Memorial Endowment Fund was initiated in the name of Mr. Manish Narayan with the objective of providing a young research scholar from the Department of Materials Engineering (formerly Metallurgy), IISc, international research exposure by supporting him/her to attend an international conference for presenting a paper.

Manish Narayan was an M.E (I) student from the Department of Metallurgy, IISc, between 1989 – 1993. His field of interest was Composites and he did his final ME project with Prof M.K. Surappa. After his graduation he had a short stint with Titan Industries, where he worked on the ‘Tanishq’ range of jewellery watches. He then went to pursue a Doctorate in NJIT & later on shifted to Lehigh. His promising academic career came to an end, when he passed away in a tragic car accident at Tennessee, USA on July 29th 1996 on his way back from Atlanta Olympics.

In the IT / communication era, with monetarily attractive software jobs all around, there were not even 15% graduates from the Department of Metallurgy who went on to pursue their career in Metallurgy. But Manish was one among those 15%.

Many of his batchmates came together to institute a fund in his name at the Department of Metallurgy, IISc, to cherish his memory and also to promote a strong research culture among students working in this area.

All students of the Department of Metallurgy are encouraged to apply for this award.

### Selection Procedure

The award is open to all academic students of the Department of Materials Engineering.
The canditate should have the paper authored or co-authored by him/her accepted in a  conference / workshop / symposium / seminar.  Preference is to be given to international events.<br>

Selection Criteria: The following criteria may be followed for the selection – Merit, Standard of the conference and Need.
The amount of the standard award is decided by the Department from time to time. At present it stands at a maximum of Rs. 25,000. The award can be shared by more than one person, in which case, the amount of the award may be decided by the selecting authority.
A student is normally eligible to receive this award only once during their tenure at IISc.
