Following are a list of open positions available at the Department of Materials Engineering.

A research position is available on a project at Indian Institute of Science to use artificial neural networks (and supervised machine learning) to extract material properties from large amounts of experimental data collected from bending tests. Bending tests under creep conditions or at constant displacement rate coupled with digital image correlation allows the collection of tens or hundreds of data sets, from a single test, of strain as a function of time at different locations of the beam that experience different stress histories . The scientific challenge lies in developing optimisation procedures to reconstruct the constitutive behaviour of the material from such big data.

A suitable candidate will have a background in engineering, with problem solving skills and knowledge of optimisation procedures, including artificial neural network and general familiarity with machine learning/big data analysis and image processing tools. Positions are available for applicants with a Masters or a PhD with relevant experience. Knowledge of materials behaviour is desirable but not essential. Compensation will be as per IISc norms and begin at a monthly salary of Rs. 31,000 + 24 % HRA for project assistants, and Rs. 47,000 + 24 % HRA for research associates for which the basic qualifications needed will be a Masters in engineering or a PhD in engineering, respectively.

Interested candidates should send their CV to Prof. Vikram Jayaram, Department of Materials Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012 through email to qjayaram@iisc.ac.in. Candidates may be called for an interview.
