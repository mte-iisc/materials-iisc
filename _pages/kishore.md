### Educational:
After a B.Sc. from University of Mysore, pursued studies at the Department of Metallurgy, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 12., for the B.E. and  M.E. degrees.  In the area of physical/mechanical metallurgy, a research programme was undertaken leading to Ph.D. degree.  As a Lecturer, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor served the department.   Later on continued as   an Emeritus Professor supported by CSIR and UGC.  Also  received the ECSIJ prize and NMD award. Had the good fortune of seeing the microscopy work from the laboratory featuring on the cover page of prestigious journal, viz., Journal of Applied Polymer Science a couple of times.. Bulletin of Materials science too carried the scanning microscopic picture details on its cover page where a work on property evaluation with a newer system was undertaken. 

### Areas of Research Interest:
Structure – Property correlations in metal- based and polymer matrix-based systems; Development and characterisation of newer polymer- based composites, friction and wear studies. Work on developing, fabrication and characterisation of   the then newer type cast iron, namely, compacted graphite cast iron yielded very encouraging results. The group saw the fabrication of a solar furnace for melting metals. Processing, fabrication, and characterisation of polymer matrix –based composites involving naturally occurring jute and sisal fibres formed another facet of the investigation.. Also involved in hybridizing naturally derived fibres with manmade ones for studying the properties of resultant systems. The group also ventured into using abundantly occurring industrial waste material like fly ash for making newer composite systems. Physical and mechanical properties’ evaluation followed the fabrication.. All these resulted in many dozens of publications for the group.
