<b>Dissertation Project</b>
 
The M.Tech. project is aimed at training the students to analyse independently any problem posed to them. The project may be a purely analytical piece of work, a completely experimental one or a combination of both. In a few cases the project can also involve a sophisticated design work. The project report is expected to show clarity of thought and expression, critical appreciation of the existing literature and analytical and/or experimental or design skill.

<b>Metal Forming Processes</b>
 
This course deals with analytical descriptions of the plasticity and metal working processes for metallic materials. The course content includes aspects of materials microstructural changes and damage development during metal working. Some of the interesting examples of industrial relevance will be also included. It caters to post-graduate students in Materials, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. 

​The objective of the course is to provide the student with a set of skills which can be applied directly to the materials processing and metal forming industries and which can serve as a basis for graduate research work in forming, materials processing and manufacturing. The course will provide the analytical basis of plasticity and its application to metal forming processes such as rolling, extrusion, wire drawing, forging and sheet metal forming. The course will deal with (i) mechanical response and testing of materials, (ii) a brief description of multiaxial plasticity in terms of yield surfaces, flow rules and anisotropic plasticity, and (iii) analytical descriptions of mechanics of rolling, extrusion, wire drawing, forging and sheet metal forming processes.
