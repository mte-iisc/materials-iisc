<b>Dissertation Project</b>
 
The M.Tech. project is aimed at training the students to analyse independently any problem posed to them. The project may be a purely analytical piece of work, a completely experimental one or a combination of both. In a few cases the project can also involve a sophisticated design work. The project report is expected to show clarity of thought and expression, critical appreciation of the existing literature and analytical and/or experimental or design skill.
