<b>M. Tech in MATERIALS ENGINEERING</b>
(Duration: 2 Years, 64 credits) 

<b>MTech students:</b> 32 credit course work (Sem I and Sem II) + 32 credit dissertation (Sem III and Sem IV) 
Minimum mandatory credits from courses within the department: 8 (3+3+2) credit hard core + 9 (3 +3+3) credits from among the basket of soft core + 9 credits from among the softcore/electives. The remaining 6 credits can be completed without restrictions (within or outside the department).

PhD students with M Tech background need to take a minimum of 12 credits and pass with minimum CGPA of 7.00. PhD students with BE/BTech/MSc degree must take a minimum of 24 credits and pass with a minimum  CGPA of 7.0.

Students with BE/BTech/MSc degree joining the M Tech (Research) program or joining the PhD program and opting for additional M Tech (Research) degree are required to take minimum of 50 % of their total required credits from the basket of  hard cores and soft cores offered by the department. This implies that students in M. Tech (Research) should take minimum 6 credits and students desirous of M. Tech (Research) degree together with PhD degree should take 12 credits from the basket of hard cores and soft cores. 

(3 extra credits in MT 250 is mandatory for those who don't have a prior background in materials related discipline. This is a non-RTP course for PhD and M. Tech (Research) students which the student must pass with minimum C-grade.)

Dissertation Project
 
The M.E. Project is aimed at training the students to analyse independently any problem posed to them.  The project may be a purely analytical piece of work. a completely experimental one or a combination of both. In a few cases. the project can also involve a sophisticated design work. The project report is expected to show clarity of thought and expression. critical appreciation of the existing literature and analytical and/or experimental or design skill.
