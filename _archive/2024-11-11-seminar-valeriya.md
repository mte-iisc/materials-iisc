### Abstract: 

Nowadays, considerable research focuses on metal organic frameworks (MOFs). They represent a class of crystalline porous materials, whose frameworks consist of metal cations or metal clusters connected by organic linkers. Their peculiar properties, including high surface area, large porosity, variable pore size and multiple functionalities, promoted them as potential materials for various applications. The current talk will be focused on the ways for the formation of MOF-based coatings and properties of obtained multifunctional surfaces.

 
### About the Speaker: 

Dr. Valeryia Kasneryk graduated in 2014 in the program of double diplomas between Chemistry Department of Moscow State University and National Great School of Chemistry of Paris (Chimie ParisTech). In 2018 she received her PhD degree in Physical Chemistry from the Faculty of Science of Charles University and J. Heyrovský Institute of Physical Chemistry in Academy of Science of the Czech Republic. The PhD thesis was devoted to the design of novel zeolite materials. Dr. Valeryia Kasneryk performed two postdoctoral studies at the Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials in Palacký University in Olomouc and the Faculty of Science of Charles University in Prague in Czechia. In 2021, she joined the Institute of Surface Science at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon in Geesthacht, Germany, as postdoctoral fellow supported by Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship.
