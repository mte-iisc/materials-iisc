### Abstract
This talk will describe our current work in titanium alloy development as it relates to biocorrosion and biocompatibility. The effect of alloy chemistry upon microstructure and relevant mechanical properties will be illustrated with particular reference to boron additions. The evaluation of the stability of these alloys in fluids of physiological relevance using electrochemical methods will be discussed. Biological aspects â€“ biocompatibility, biofilms - will also be presented. The current state of our understanding from the studies thus far and the path forward will be discussed.
