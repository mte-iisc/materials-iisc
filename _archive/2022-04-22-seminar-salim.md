### Abstract
Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) failures are sudden, costly, and catastrophic. Yet, HE is easily preventable. Education and PREVENTION are far less expensive than dealing with an HE failure. The webinar is designed to present the latest knowledge related to hydrogen embrittlement, translated into concepts that are easy to understand and to provide concrete guidance on how to apply mitigation steps with high strength fasteners. The following topics will be discussed:
<ul>
<li>General description of hydrogen embrittlement</li>
<li>Hydrogen damage mechanism</li>
<li>Fracture morphology</li>
<li>Root cause and triggers for hydrogen embrittlement failure</li>
<li>Material susceptibility</li>
<li>Case-hardened fasteners</li>
<li>Stress relief prior to electroplating</li>
<li>Baking</li>
<li>Thread rolled after heat treatment</li>
<li>Hydrogen embrittlement test methods</li>
</ul>
