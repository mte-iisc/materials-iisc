### Abstract
Here, we investigate the effect of high-pressure torsion (HPT), a severe  plastic deformation process, on the mechanical properties, corrosion,  and cytotoxicity of Mg-6Zn-0.2Ce alloy, a candidate material for  bioresorbable bone implants. This alloy was processed by  quasi-constrained HPT by applying a pressure of 6 GPa at room  temperature for 1, 2, and 5 turns. Samples processed to two turns of HPT  showed the smallest grain size, the highest strength that was  approximately five times higher than the as-received coarse-grained  sample and a reduction in the ductility. Electrochemical impedance  spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization demonstrated the highest  corrosion resistance for the Mg-alloy processed for two turns of HPT;  however, accelerated degradation due to pitting corrosion was observed  after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for three days.  Nevertheless, all HPT-processed samples showed lower corrosion rates in  all corrosion tests compared to their annealed counterparts. Finally,  cell culture revealed good cytocompatibility without any noticeable  changes in cytotoxicity following HPT processing. Overall, HPT for two  turns showed enhanced strength and reduced corrosion rates without loss  in cytocompatibility for the Mg-6Zn-0.2Ce alloy, making it a promising  strategy to enhance the performance of the alloy as a bioresorbable  orthopedic biomaterial. This work highlights the potential of HPT as a  viable technique to improve the biomedical performance of Mg alloys for  engineering next-generation biomedical implants.
