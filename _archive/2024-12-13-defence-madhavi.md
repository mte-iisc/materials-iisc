### Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a major public health threat  in the US, even with successful early-stage surgeries. Recurrence and  advanced stages present complex diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.  Traditional treatments, such
 as chemotherapy and targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (TKIs), face is-
 sues including non-specific targeting, toxicity, poor absorption, and  the development
 of resistance. Overcoming resistance due to genetic mutations and tumor  hetero-
 geneity is crucial, highlighting the need to identify novel  vulnerabilities in NSCLC for
 continued treatment progress. Also, combination therapy is being widely  explored to
 overcome this problem. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising  emerging cancer
 treatment. PTT uses photothermal transduction agents (PTAs) to convert  light energy
 into heat, inducing cancer cell death. PTT’s advantages include precise  tumor targeting
 through adjustable laser irradiation, minimizing damage to healthy  tissues, and being a
 highly effective, non-invasive treatment. Effective PTAs should have  high photothermal
 conversion efficiency (PCE), non-overlapping absorption with tumor  background, and
 strong tumor accumulation.
 Moreover, PTT agents can serve as exogenous contrast agents for  photoacoustic
 imaging (PAI), enabling light-based theranostics. PAI is a non-invasive  imaging tech-
 nique that uses light and sound waves to produce high-resolution optical  images of
 internal tissues. Combined with PTT, PAI can track the delivery of  light-absorbing PTT
 agents to the target site and monitor the treatment in real-time,  minimizing damage
 to healthy tissues. This approach reduces side effects and increases  treatment effec-
 tiveness. Nano PTAs, which leverage the enhanced permeability and  retention (EPR)
 effect and active targeting, show particular promise.
 Past decades have seen advancement in nanoparticle-based drug delivery  plat-
 forms. However, advancements in nano-drug delivery platforms often face  challenges
 in penetrating deep into the tumor microenvironment due to their size  and design.
 Smaller nanoparticles can penetrate deeply but are easily washed away,  while larger
 ones remain at the tumor site but fail to penetrate deeply. Modifying  nanoparticle size,
 surface chemistry, and other properties can improve circulation time,  tumor targeting,and penetration. Innovative designs that change size  upon reaching the tumor site can
 enhance circulation and effective tumor distribution. Addressing these  challenges and
 exploring new strategies can maximize the potential of nanoparticle drug  delivery for
 improved cancer treatment outcomes.
 To address the current gaps in the field, we have explored the loading  of CuS
 nanoparticles (5-20 nm) into smart thermoresponsive nanogels (200-225  nm) along-
 side an FDA-approved TKI for lung cancer, targeting the EGFR to achieve  stimuli-
 responsive combinatorial therapy. This innovative multi-stage approach  has aimed to
 enhance deep tumor targeting. Upon encountering specific stimuli, the  nanogel has
 been designed to degrade in the tumor environment, facilitating the  targeted release of
 the drug into the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we have aimed to  investigate
 the potential of coating this loaded nanogel with RBC membrane, thereby  mimicking its
 behavior to avoid opsonization. Combining CuS nanoparticles, a targeted  drug, and a
 stimuli-responsive release mechanism within a nanogel system, this study  should offer
 a promising strategy for achieving more effective and precise deep tumor  theranostics
 for lung cancer.
 The first task was to prepare CuS nanoparticles with appropriate  photothermal ef-
 ficiency, along with suitable particle size and molecular targeting  capability. We syn-
 thesized CuS nanoparticles with PVP as a stabilizing agent, producing  PC10, PCK30,
 and PC40 variants. We investigated how different PVP molecular weights  affect their
 crystalline properties and photoacoustic/photothermal responses. All  nanoparticles
 showed a crystalline structure, were <(><<)>10 nm, and exhibited  absorbance peaks at 1020
 nm, indicating strong photoacoustic and photothermal capabilities. PC10  stood out with
 superior photoacoustic properties and achieved a remarkable photothermal  efficiency
 of 51%. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed cell compatibility and enhanced  apoptosis rates.
 These results highlight the potential of PVP-stabilized CuS  nanoparticles for advanced
 cancer theranostics. The system’s crucial limitation was the inability  to achieve tar-
 geted functionality without complex ring-opening reactions. We then  investigated an
 alternative system aiming for both optimal photothermal efficiency and  targeted deliv-
 ery.
 Prior studies have shown anti-cancer properties of functionalized gold  (Au) nanoparticles, leading to the exploration of CuS/Au nanohybrids for  imaging and therapy. This
 study focuses on developing ultra-small CuS-Au (TSP-CA) nanohybrids  using seed-
 mediated galvanic reduction with tannic acid (TA) and sodium citrate  (SC) as reducing
 agents. PVP-CuS nanoparticles, prepared from previous research, were  used, and
 TSP-CA nanohybrids averaging 8 nm in size were formed, confirmed by  X-ray photo-
 electron spectroscopy (XPS) showing the presence of Cu and Au.  Photoacoustic (PA)
 experiments showed a higher signal-to-noise ratio, with photothermal  therapy (PTT)
 efficiency estimated at 25%, demonstrating good photostability. In vitro  experiments
 indicated ROS-mediated anticancer effects on lung cancer cells. Ex vivo  studies using
 chicken breast confirmed PTT and PA signal generation at depths of 1 cm  and 1.5 cm,
 with PA signals measured using a 2.25 MHz ultrasound transducer and a  960 nm laser
 at 1 cm depth. ROS and apoptosis studies revealed enhanced anticancer  effects of
 the hybrid nanoparticles compared to individual nanoparticles. However,  this system
 showed a considerable decrease in photothermal efficiency compared to  our previous
 study. This decrease would compel us to use higher concentrations of  particles to
 achieve the desired anti-cancer effect. We moved on to exploring other  materials for
 CuS synthesis, which could offer the desired properties.
 While the interaction between mucin and cancer cells is still under  exploration,
 mucin shows promise for developing nanoparticles for theranostics due to  its stability-
 enhancing properties. However, mucin has not yet been utilized to  synthesize copper
 sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles. This study investigates using mucin as a  capping agent for
 CuS (Mu@CuS) nanoparticles to enhance stability for optical theranostic  applications.
 The resulting nanoparticles, less than 10 nm in size, were crystalline  and exhibited
 absorbance in the NIR II region, demonstrating optimal photothermal  efficiency (38%)
 and photoacoustic contrast abilities. To explore targeting ability and  cellular uptake,
 Rhodamine B was conjugated to the mucin-coated CuS nanoparticles  (Mu@CuS-Rh),
 exploiting the negative charges on cancer cell membranes for  mitochondrial delivery.
 Experiments on 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid models showed deep tumor  pene-
 tration and effective photothermal therapeutic effects. Since the  particles exhibited all
 the desirable attributes, they were tested for deep tumor penetration  ability in vivo.
 In vivo, Multispectral optoacoustic imaging analysis of Mu@CuS-Rh  nanoparticles re-
 vealed significant tumor uptake and retention for up to 7 hours, with  notable accumulation in hypoxic tumor regions. Interestingly, these  particles underscore the potential of
 Mu@CuS nanoparticles for hypoxic tumor imaging and targeted therapy as  well.
 A thermoresponsive nanogel was developed using NIPAM and MAA to ensure  ma-
 terial delivery only upon thermal stimulation. Various NIPAM and MAA  ratios were
 tested to achieve a sol-gel transition temperature above body  temperature. At 8% MAA,
 the transition temperature rose to 35°C, with most of the transition  occurring above
 40°C, indicating potential for temperature-triggered drug release. To  address gaps
 in the field, CuS nanoparticles were loaded into these nanogels along  with the FDA-
 approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib, targeting EGFR receptors  in lung cancer.
 Mu@CuS was incorporated in situ during polymerization, while Erlotinib  was loaded
 post-synthesis. TEM and SEM characterization confirmed successful  loading. Combi-
 nation anti-cancer studies on lung cancer cell lines showed that the  concentrations of
 Mu@CuS and Erlotinib could be reduced when used together, indicating a  synergistic
 effect. Furthermore, the loaded nanogel was wrapped with an RBC membrane  to form
 a composite (R@Ng-MuC/Er) for combinatorial theranostics. The  photothermal evalu-
 ation showed that the composite nanoparticles could increase the  temperature to 50°C
 when 1 mg was dispersed in PBS. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies  demonstrated
 the composite’s superior efficiency over Mu@CuS and Erlotinib alone. In  vivo studies
 indicated significant tumor reduction in mice treated with R@Ng-MuC/Er,  without toxic
 effects on major organs, as suggested by histology. Also, multispectral  optoacoustic
 tomography suggested appropriate composite accumulation in the tumor  microenvi-
 ronment, further explored for imaging and therapy. A biodistribution  study suggested
 major clearance of particles by the liver. The diagnostic properties  were evaluated
 using MSOT, confirming the composite’s potential for precise tumor  theranostics.
 In conclusion, the developed system successfully achieved all the  objectives of our
 study. Among various CuS nanoparticles, mucin-coated CuS nanoparticles  (Mu@CuS)
 exhibited the most promising therapeutic potential. These nanoparticles  showed en-
 hanced interaction with tumor cells, even in hypoxic conditions.  Combined with Erlotinib
 and loaded into thermoresponsive nanogels, they provided a synergistic  effect for com-
 binatorial chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, ensuring on-demand  release and
 minimizing unnecessary interactions with normal cells. The potential of  these nanopar
 ticles for photoacoustic tomography further supports their use in  image-guided cancer
 therapy. Their similarity to red blood cells suggests significant  potential to evade im-
 mune responses, though further characterization is needed. In vivo  experiments re-
 vealed substantial tumor regression with tumor imaging properties,  highlighting their
 promising potential for lung cancer treatment. This system warrants  further evaluation
 to advance towards clinical translation.
