### Abstract:Inspired by the recent advancements and successes of artificial intelligence (AI) and machinelearning (ML), several materials intelligence ecosystems are emerging. These include the
design of materials that meet target property requirements, either by closed-loop active-learning strategies or by inverting the prediction pipeline using advanced generativealgorithms. AI and ML concepts are also transforming the computational and physicallaboratory infrastructural landscapes—surrogate models that can outperform physics-based
simulations by several orders of magnitude in speed while preserving their accuracy arebeing actively developed. Integration of such AI/ML approaches with high-throughputexperimentation can facilitate autonomous materials discovery with enormous efficiency. Inthis talk, I will first touch upon my research experience on a range of computational and
AI/ML approaches for materials design. Then, I will cover two materials design problems indetail: discovery of polymers for high energy capacitor applications, and design of self-assembling peptides. I will demonstrate how AI/ML can be used to screen promising
candidates, reveal novel material structure-property relationships, and/or overcomeprevailing human-researcher biases. I will also discuss my future plans to develop a strongmaterials informatics research and teaching program at IISc Bangalore.

### Brief Bio:Dr. Rohit Batra joined the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at IITMadras as Assistant Professor in July 2022. Prior to this he had completed two Post-doctoraldoctoral appointments, one at Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National Lab, and
the other at School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.Rohit received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from University of Connecticutand B.Tech. in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from IIT Roorkee. Before joining IITMadras he also had a stint at Rivian Automotive LLC’s R&D lab for cell manufacturing and
battery development.Rohit's research interest lies in the area of combining computational and data-driven methods to design new materials. He has expertise in first-principles electronic structure methods, molecular dynamics simulations, and many machine learning (ML) based techniques, particularly geared towards the general field of chemical and materials science.
