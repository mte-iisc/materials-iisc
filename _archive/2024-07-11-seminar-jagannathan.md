### Abstract
The microstructure of thin metallic films plays a predominant role in determining their mechanical and physical properties. Hence, it is critical to control the micro/nanostructure of the films to tailor their properties for various applications. In this talk, I will provide an overview of our labâ€™s efforts to synthesize metallic films with precisely controlled microstructures using physical vapor deposition. Specifically, I will describe new methods we have developed to tailor the microstructures of intermetallic films using seed-mediated crystallization of amorphous precursors and elemental metallic films using heteroepitaxial growth on patterned substrates. I will also discuss how these synthesis methods can be used to tune the mechanical properties of the films and systematically explore their structure-property relationships.
