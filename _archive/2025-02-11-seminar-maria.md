### Abstract:  

Additive manufacturing is currently widely recognized as a valuable enabler of industrial sustainability and digitalization as it allows exceptional design freedom, part customization and lightweighting. This talk will further emphasize the capability of additive manufacturing technologies and, in particular, of selective laser melting, to add value to metallic materials by generating unprecedented microstructures. Highlighted examples include grain boundary engineering in aerospace alloys [1], quasicrystal precipitation in high temperature aluminum alloys [2], and nanocrystalline-amorphous composites for soft magnetics [3].

### Speaker Bio:

Dr. Teresa PÉREZ-PRADO, Senior Scientist, heads since 2008 the Sustainable Metallurgy group at IMDEA Materials Institute. Teresa was Division Leader between 2014 and 2017 and Deputy Director between 2017 and 2021. From 2018 to 2022 she coordinated the programme on Structural Materials at the Spanish National Science Foundation. Dr. Pérez-Prado got a PhD in Physics at the Complutense University in Madrid in 1998 and an MBA at INSEAD, France, in 2008. After a 2 year postdoctoral stay at the University of California in San Diego, USA, she joined the National Center for Metals Research (Madrid, Spain) in 2001, where she worked as a tenure-track fellow until she was granted a Tenured Scientist position in 2004. Dr. Pérez-Prado has coauthored 150 papers (h 51, ≈10K citations (Google Scholar)), 1 book (Elsevier, 2004) and 3 patents. Teresa has been a member of the Scientific Council of the Nomaten Center of Excellence (Poland, until 2023), the IRT Jules Verne (France, until 2024), the Henry Royce Institute (UK), and the European Space Agency (ESA, until 2024).
