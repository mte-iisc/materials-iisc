### Abstract
Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has gained considerable interest  because of its ability of near net shape building of the components,  one-go production, ability to make intricate designs and minimized  wastage. Further, the mechanical properties of the manufactured alloys  are sometimes reported to be superior due to various microstructural  attributes.
This presentation deals with the work carried out to examine the  evolution of microstructure, crystallographic texture and their inf= luence on the mechanical properties on the material system 316L manufactured through selective laser melting (SLM) and wire arc  additive manufacturing (WAAM). The effect of different scan strategies  such as inter-layer and intra-layer on microstructure-texture-mechanical  property correlation has been investigated on SLM 316L. The benefits of  as built microstructure and texture of SLM and WAAM 316L on mechanical  properties has been critically evaluated through tension and fracture  toughness studies. Moreover, the role of important heat treatment on  thermal stability of structure and mechanical properties are also  examined. Apart from this, a spinodal hardened alloy system Cu-15Ni-8Sn  manufactured through SLM has also been studied in order to find how  benefits of additive manufacturing behaves in this alloy. The role of  ageing treatment that brings spinodal hardening in Cu-15Ni-8Sn is also  investigated in the present study.
