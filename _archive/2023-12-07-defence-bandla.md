### Abstract
On the creep behavior of Ni based solid solution alloys from binary to  quaternary
 A power-law relationship between the steady state strain rate (ε ̇) and  imposed stress (σ) is well established so that the ε ̇∝σ^n, at a fixed  temperature, where n is termed the stress exponent. Additional  microstructural terms influencing creep such as the grain size and  stacking fault energy (γ) have been incorporated into the creep equation  in a power-law form, such as ε ̇∝γ^q. In the case of an intragranular  dislocation climb controlled creep in a solid solution alloy, the creep  rate has been expressed as ε ̇∝Dσ^5 γ^3, where D is the appropriate  diffusion coefficient, n~5 and q~3. However, an evaluation of the  earlier creep data suggests that while q~3 is reasonable for pure  metals, there is considerable uncertainty in the value of q for solid  solution alloys.
 The current study focuses on characterizing the creep behavior and the  value of q for Ni – xCo alloys, with x = 10, 33, and 60, where the  addition of Co reduces the stacking fault energy. Following creep in  Ni-Co alloys, the creep behaviour of CSSAs NiCoCr and NiCoCrFe was also  investigated to probe potential changes in the creep mechanisms with the  addition of alloying element. All alloys are single phase solid  solutions with a face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) crystal structure. Prior  to the creep, all alloys had a grain size d~100 µm. The observed  stacking fault energies through weak beam dark field technique are 10 –  36 mJ m-2 for Ni – 60 Co, 14 – 27 mJ m-2 for NiCoCr, and 11 – 26 mJ m-2  for NiCoCrFe alloys. At a creep testing temperature of 1015 K, the  stress exponent n ~ 5 for binary Ni – Co alloys, suggesting that  dislocation climb is the creep rate controlling mechanism. The cell  structure observed through electron channel contrast imaging in the  crept samples of the alloys is consistent with a dislocation climb  mechanism. The stacking fault energy exponent q ~ 2 in Ni– (x) Co binary  solid solution alloys.
 At 990 K, the creep rates of the NiCoCr and NiCoCrFe alloys were  observed to be similar with a stress exponent n~5. Both the ternary and  quaternary alloys showed significantly lower creep rates compared to the  Ni – (x) Co binary alloys. Creep deformation did not cause any phase  change in the NiCoCrFe alloy. Although the Ni – (x) Co alloys, NiCoCr,  and NiCoCrFe alloys exhibited a similar stress exponent of n~5, the  crept substructure in the NiCoCr and NiCoCrFe alloy showed planar band  features.  The possible causes for the observed differences in creep  behavior between the Ni-Co binary alloys and the other concentrated  solid solution alloys will be discussed.
