### Abstract
The increasing demand for advanced sensing technologies has driven efforts to integrate silicon technology with organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), combining their complementary strengths. Silicon-based devices offer compatibility with existing electronic frameworks, while polymer-based OFETs, such as those employing P3HT, exhibit versatility for sensing applications due to their tunable properties, low-power requirements, and scalable fabrication. This study introduces a conceptual framework for designing and fabricating hybrid systems, focusing on the interplay between silicon-compatible dielectrics and polymer semiconductors.

Key architectures were developed to optimize the dielectric-semiconductor interface, addressing challenges in electronic behaviour, molecular organization, and structural stability. Modifications to dielectric surfaces aimed to reduce defects and enhance interactions with the active semiconductor layer, improving charge transport and minimizing hysteresis. Surface treatments were analyzed for their impact on the crystalline structure of polymer films, demonstrating the importance of precise dielectric engineering to achieve high device performance.

Fabrication methodologies focused on creating miniaturized device architectures with reliable gating mechanisms. Challenges included achieving uniform dielectric layers, managing defects during interface preparation, and ensuring consistency in channel dimensions at sub-micron scales. The study also explored the transition to alternative gating materials, such as silicides, to address limitations in conventional gate designs. These advancements enabled enhanced electric field control and scalable device fabrication while overcoming challenges related to dielectric uniformity and electronic properties.

The analysis emphasized the role of surface properties, molecular arrangement, and material interfaces in determining device performance. By systematically addressing fabrication and material optimization challenges, this work establishes a foundation for developing scalable hybrid systems that integrate silicon technology with polymer-based OFETs. These findings contribute to advancing sensing applications through tailored architectures, improved device reliability, and high-performance solutions.
