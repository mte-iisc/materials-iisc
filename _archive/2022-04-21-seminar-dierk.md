### Abstract
The solution of continuum mechanical boundary value problems requires constitutive laws that are based on material physics and that connect deformation, damage, transformation and stress at each material point. These often non-linearly coupled phenomena have been implemented in the free software DAMASK on the basis of the crystal plasticity and phase field methods using several constitutive laws and homogenization methods. Here we present recent progress in this multi-physics chemo-mechanical crystal plasticity and phase transformation simulation package and show applications to metallic alloys. Focus is placed on the interplay of alloy thermodynamics and micromechanics of steels and aluminium alloys, implementation of damage models, coupling between damage and deformation, high resolution simulations and coarse graining towards applications for yield surface and forming problems. Some recent ideas on using machine learning in crystal mechanics modeling will be also presented.
