### Speaker and Affliation:
Dr. Jakub Holzer<br>
ThermoFisher Scientific in Brno, Czech Republic 

### When?
18<sup>th</sup> July, 2024 (Thursday), 03.30 PM (India Standard Time)

### Where
KPA Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore

### Abstract: 
Direct electron detection is an emerging technology in the field of detection science and the industry is slowly undergoing the same change and it experienced when Si-Li EDS detector became obsolete with arrival of silicon drift detectors. The talk will focus on advantages of direct electron detection sensors used in SEM and SDBs, especially in Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. portfolio of microscopes. The main topics will be standard EBSD geometry (70 deg tilt), Reflection Kikuchi Diffraction and 4DSTEM/TKD application
