### Abstract
According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 1.71 billion of the world population have a musculoskeletal (MSK) condition. These conditions are the largest contributor to disability worldwide, placing significant clinical and financial burden on societies. In order to further our understanding of MSK conditions and develop suitable interventions, the clinical priority areas need to be addressed.

In this talk, Dr. Player will provide an overview of the multidisciplinary nature of his work, that has developed from identified patient and clinical need. Using an integrative approach to investigate musculoskeletal conditions in health and disease, Darren uses in silico, in vitro (monolayer cell culture), tissue engineered and in vivo (human) models. In recent years, he has also worked closely with Biomedical Engineers to develop and test devices for monitoring MSK health.

He has published papers in a broad range of internationally recognised journals including; Biomaterials, the Journal of Tissue Engineering, the Journal of Molecular Endocrinology, and the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine. Darren has also published a number of book chapters and has been invited to present his research at many national and international conferences. He acts as a consultant and scientific advisor to a number of companies and the UK media, with his work contributing to BBC television programmes and featured newspaper articles.
