### Abstract
‘Bloating’ i.e. swelling of droplets is an important phenomenon in oxygen steelmaking process which determines the overall process efficiency by influencing the kinetics of refining. This phenomenon is controlled mainly by decarburization reaction kinetics. In this work, a mathematical model for decarburization of a droplet was developed incorporating all kinetic steps. This model demonstrated remarkably well performance with variation of experimental parameters and specifically with conditions similar to oxygen steelmaking. Another finding from this work was development of a novel kinetic model to incorporate slag electrical conductivity effect into analysis which is generally ignored by process metallurgist for decades despite knowing the nature of the system.
Battery Recycling
Extraction of cobalt from secondary resources has become crucial as it has been identified as strategically important and a critical raw material due to the high risks of supply chain disruptions. In this work, selective sulfation roasting followed by water leaching was investigated as a potential recycling strategy to extract cobalt and lithium from industrial LCO-rich black mass. Specifically, the effect of graphite on metals extraction was studied. A selective extraction efficiency of 99.5% Li and 60% Co by was obtained by this route.
