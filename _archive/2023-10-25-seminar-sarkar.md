### Abstract:
High entropy oxides (HEOs) represent an emerging class of single-phase oxide solid solutions consisting of multiple cations in near-equiatomic proportions occupying a specific sub-lattice. HEOs were first reported in 2015, and over the last five years, the field has witnessed rapid growth. Within the framework of our research work, we have addressed several fundamental and applied aspects of HEOs, which have been pivotal in the development of this research topic. This presentation will initially focus on the discovery of HEO classes (and compositions) and their diverse synthesis routes. The extensive compositional flexibility of HEOs offers the possibility to tailor a plethora of functionalities. In this context, initial case studies pertaining to three unique/improved functionalities of HEOs, such as enhanced electrochemical cyclic stability, tunable optical properties, and exotic magneto-electronic properties, will be presented. Special emphasis will be placed on the electrochemical energy storage applications of HEOs, which appear to be a promising research direction. While these opportunities hold potential for future applications, researchers working on HEOs face multiple challenges in terms of precisely identifying the local atomistic features of HEOs. Hence, some of the possible approaches to tackle these challenges will be discussed. In summary, the presentation will provide an overview of the versatility of the multicomponent high entropy based design approach for engineering the structure and properties of oxide systems.
