### Abstract: 
The synthesis of bulk crystals, thin films, and nanostructures is a crucial aspect of advancing the frontiers of quantum materials. In this research seminar, I will provide a synthesis perspective on how the discovery of quantum materials occurs and how their exotic properties are encountered. Firstly, I will introduce a general paradigm of bulk crystal growth of quantum materials using various techniques and how bulk crystal growers strategically encounter exotic phenomena, exploiting materials composition, structure, symmetry, and topology. Then, I will discuss in detail my recent discovery of colossal angular magneto resistance in a ferrimagnetic nodal line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6, with an extremely large angular response of magnetotransport (~1010). I will also briefly discuss my recent discovery of a new material MnCuSiTe3, showing room temperature ferroelectricity using Piezo Force Microscopy and low-temperature magnetic ordering. Finally, I will conclude my talk by discussing recent trends and future directions in magnetic quantum materials/2D materials.
