### Abstract
We in situ observe the ultrafast dynamics of trapped carriers in organic methyl ammonium lead halide perovskite thin films by ultrafast photocurrent spectroscopy with a sub-25 picosecond time resolution. Upon ultrafast laser excitation, trapped carriers follow a phonon-assisted tunneling mechanism and a hopping transport mechanism along ultra-shallow to shallow trap states ranging from 1.72-11.51 millielectronvolts and are demonstrated by time-dependent and independent activation energies. In addition to carrier mobility of ~ 4 cm2/V.s and lifetime of ~ 1 nanosecond, we validate the above transport mechanisms by highlighting trap state dynamics, including trapping rates, de-trapping rates, and trap properties such as trap density, trap levels, and capture-cross sections. This work [1] establishes a foundation for trap dynamics in high defect-tolerant perovskites with ultra-fast temporal and ultra-high energy resolution.
