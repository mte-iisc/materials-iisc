### Abstract:
Superalloys are special class of high temperature alloys that are used  for making components in gas-turbine engines, catalytic reactors which  are exposed to highly corrosive atmospheres. These alloys have  exceptional oxidation resistance, creep resistance, high temperature  strength as well as ductility. These alloys are primarily based on Ni,  Co, Fe and Ti because of their high melting point (>1400°C). The  efficiency of an engine primarily relies on higher inlet temperatures.  The higher melting points of these alloys and good oxidation resistant  enable higher working temperature for the engines.

 Ni-based superalloys are widely used in aerospace (aircraft engines,  turbine blades) as well as power-generation industries (steam turbines).  Ni does not undergo phase transformations and retains its FCC structure  until melting. Additionally, it can form uniform coherent precipitates,  Ni3(Al, Ti) with ordered L12 structure in the FCC γ matrix. These are  also stable at the application temperatures imparting the required  strength and creep resistance. Moreover, the alloying elements (Ta, Re,  W, Mo) help in improving the creep strength, oxidation resistance and  increasing the solvus temperature. Other elements such as Co, Cr and Hf  are also present in CMSX-4, one of the most popular Ni-based  superalloys.

 Aircraft fuels contain hydrocarbons, olefins, paraffins, naphthenes,  aromatics and cycloparaffins. Air is also sucked in from the atmosphere  to enable combustion of the fuel. Therefore, the turbine blades are  exposed to a very harsh mixture of corrosive gases at high temperatures.  Since CMSX-4 consists of ten elements, the process of oxidation is  highly complex. For improving the alloy’s oxidation resistance, it is  important to understand the oxidation process.

 In the current study, the evolution of oxide layers during the exposure  of CMSX-4 at 900°C in the presence of four different gases (air, oxygen,  carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide) is studied. These gases are  generally present in the combustion products and are expected to corrode  the turbine blades. The CMSX-4 samples with four different thermal and  mechanical processed conditions having different microstructural  features are studied in this work. These are:

 1. Solutionised state (without γ' precipitates)

 2. Solutionised and aged at 900oC (standard CMSX-4 with γ-γ'  microstructure)

 3. Aged at 900°C and creep deformed at 800°C (γ-γ' with stacking faults,  micro twins, and having increased dislocation density)

 4. Aged and creep deformed at 1000°C (γ-γ' with a high density of γ-γ'  interfacial dislocation network and antiphase boundaries)

 These four conditions allowed for exploring the understanding of the  effect of microstructure and defects on oxidation resistance.

 The initial part of the study involved the design of the experimental  setup to neutralise CO2 and SO2 gases used for oxidation. Experiments  were conducted in a controlled setup of a three-zone vacuum furnace. The  oxidised samples were characterised by XRD, SEM, EPMA and TEM to  identify the oxidation products. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was  also performed to quantify the mass gain associated with oxidation.

 The samples that crept at 800°C had the best oxidation resistance under  air, oxygen and SO2 atmospheres. The standard CMSX-4 (aged sample) had  the highest oxidation resistance only under CO2 atmosphere. The solutionised samples were found to have the lowest oxidation resistance  in all atmospheres. It is found that the resistance to air and oxygen  atmospheres increases when the conditions are favourable for the  diffusion of aluminium to the oxide-metal interface. The oxidation under  CO2 is found to be a balance between the adsorption and reaction  kinetics. The stability of NiSO4 under the reaction conditions decides  the oxidation mechanism under SO2. Overall, with this study, it was  possible to characterize the different oxides formed in different  microstructures under various atmospheres. Additionally, the mechanisms  for oxidising different microstructures under four different atmospheres  were proposed. These results can be utilised to further optimise the  microstructure of the alloy according to the reaction conditions  (presence of carbon, sulphur and oxygen).
