### Abstract
Laser Additive Manufacturing (AM) has gained significant traction in the last two decades not only for enabling complex designs but also for fabricating metal alloys and composites that are challenging to fabricate via traditional manufacturing techniques. However, Laser AM produces parts with highly unconventional microstructures, resulting in mechanical and functional properties that are drastically different from the traditionally processed counterparts. In this presentation, the microstructural evolution and microstructure-property correlation in two additively manufactured commercial ÔÅ¢-titanium alloys, Ti-185 and Ti-1023, will be discussed. The results signify a novel capability for AM, i.e., tuning of the microstructures via process parameter manipulation for targeted mechanical properties.
