### Abstract
Damage evolution in AA7075 is complex due to the presence of different second phase particles in the microstructure. Different particle stoichiometries, each with unique mechanical properties and geometrical features, can have a cumulative effect on damage with increasing applied loading.

A study of damage in such microstructures necessitates a hierarchical multiscale approach that effectively combines numerical modelling at different length scales with complementary experiments. Microscale finite element (FE) models created from actual microstructures using electron micrographs and tomography data, can capture real particle distribution along with key geometrical features of each particle stoichiometries. Additionally, nanoscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide important cohesive properties describing interphases of various particles embedded in the matrix. Complementary experiments, such as in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray computed tomography (XCT) tensile tests etc.,  yield important data necessary for both FE model calibration and validation.

Particle fracture marginally dominates particle decohesion. At low plastic strains, void nucleation is initiated by decohesion and fracture of coarse Fe-rich particles, which facilitate formation of localized deformation bands. At large plastic strains, elevated stresses within the localized bands facilitate decohesion and fracture of more resistant η and θ precipitates. The effect of particle morphology and size is significant. Void coalescence occurs along deformation bands driven by higher stresses due to accumulated plastic strain within the bands, in a process known as void sheeting.
