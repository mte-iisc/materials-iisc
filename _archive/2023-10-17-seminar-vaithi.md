### Abstract:
For decades, the widespread application of thermoelectric generators has been hampered by two major limitations: heat stagnation in their legs, which limits power conversion efficiency, and the inherent brittleness of their constituents, accelerating thermoelectric generator failure. While notable progress has been made in overcoming these fundamental flaws, the state-of-the-art still grapples with an apparent mismatch between thermoelectric performance and mechanical toughness. To enhance the power conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials and devices, we present various strategies involving defect engineering, interface engineering, and composite techniques. These strategies have been demonstrated across different families of thermoelectric materials, including metal chalcogenides, tetrahedrites, metal iodides, and other metal composites. Finally, we introduce sustainable large-scale development of thermoelectric modules using 3D printing technologies to achieve ultrahigh thermoelectric efficiencies.
