### Abstract
With an increasing demand for energy, it has become necessary to scope out new sources of renewable energy. In 2012, Prof. Zhong-Lin Wang and co-workers at Georgia Tech reported the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a new source of energy, which basically works on the principle of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction. The TENG can be assembled within a few minutes using off-the-shelf materials and used for harvesting mechanical energy from the environment which is otherwise wasted. The TENG has a very simple working mechanism, and simple design, and can be used to power many small wearable electronics. A few examples of TENGs devised at the Clemson Nanomaterials Institute will be presented.


A thermoelectric generator (TEG) converts waste heat into usable energy. The TEGs are emerging as viable renewable energy sources, which directly convert the waste heat into electricity. The efficiency of a TEG is related to its figure-of-merit ZT= S2s/k, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, s and k are the electrical and thermal conductivities, respectively. The inherent challenges for increasing ZT will be discussed, and the use of Raman spectroscopy as a facile tool to quantify anharmonicity in thermoelectric materials will be presented.
