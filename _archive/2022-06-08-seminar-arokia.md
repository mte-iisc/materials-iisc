### Abstract
A key design consideration in flexible electronics, particularly for wearables and sensing applications, is low voltage, low power operation. This requirement not only serves to maximise battery lifetime but crucially ensures operational stability of thin film transistor (TFT) circuits and systems. Ultralow voltage/current operation is especially important in sensor interfaces so as to achieve a high resolution of the sensory signal. This presentation will review the TFT design and materials selection strategies for ultralow power operation. We examine the main issues that lead to a high operating voltage of the TFT, and discuss processing conditions for suppressing the interface trap density. Recent advances in low-voltage thin-film transistors show it is possible for the subthreshold slope to approach the thermionic limit, q/kT. Based on these considerations, an all-inkjet-printed ultra-low-power high-gain amplifier, applied to eye movement tracking by detecting human electrooculogram signals, is presented.
