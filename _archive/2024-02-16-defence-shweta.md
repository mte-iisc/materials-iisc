### Abstract
Rapid industrialization and expansion of urban landscapes in large    cities generate maximum polluting ingredients to the surrounding    environment. While organic pollutants occur naturally, the rise in    anthropogenic and geogenic activities has contributed to an increase  in   inorganic pollutants in groundwater resources. These toxic  by-products   should be detected and remedied from the start of the  polluting source   itself before it reaches out to the ecosystem.  Monitoring these   inorganic pollutants is imperative to avoid their  adverse impacts on   ecological and human health. Thus far, variegated  detection systems  have  been reported; however, restricted selectivity,  specificity and   uncompetitive lower limit of detection impede their  extensive   deployment. Additionally, sophisticated, and advanced  instruments   available for the identification of heavy-metal toxins  require skilled   technicians for appropriate interpretation.
   Although the traditional colourimetric and/or fluorimetric methods of    detecting these analytes are common, there is an underlying hindrance   in  the detection limit, and ease of usage.  Contextually, solid-state    sensors are a better alternative as they operate on low power, provide   a  better detection limit and have higher reliability. To this extent,   my  thesis focuses on the design and testing of solid-state sensors to    detect analytes such as nitrates, fluorides, and the mutagenic    carcinogenic heavy metal hexavalent chromium.
   Metal-oxide-based solid-state sensors have often exhibited a lack of    selectivity and specificity. Hence, the work presented here explores a    low-cost alternative viz., bandgap engineered organic conjugated    molecular sensors. Biomimetic-based molecular architecturing of a    thiourea-based carbon nanocomposite has been developed to selectively    detect nitrate ions in water with a detection limit of 10 ppm. The    device architecture is that of a chemiresistor. The notorious  inorganic   contaminant, nitrate, has a high interference from fluoride  ion.   Consequently, a selective fluoride sensor has also been reported,  which   shows a limited response to nitrate ions. A statistical    dimensional-reduction method called ‘Principal Component Analysis’   (PCA)  has been employed to achieve pattern recognition by minimising   the loss  of data.
   Furthermore, fluorimetric and solid-state sensing methods have been    established to detect mutagenic hexavalent chromium. The fluorimetric    titration method has shown a detection limit of 9µM and this was   further  improved by fabricating a carbon-nanocomposite-based  thick-film   chemiresistive sensor, with a limit of detection of 1 ppm.  The   solid-state sensor reported for this purpose employs a  ‘doctor-blading’   technique to achieve enhanced response, in addition  to high reliability   and repeatability.
   We have then developed a lesser-explored phenolphthalein-structured    Schiff base molecular library for the objective study of colourimetric    and fluorimetric detection of iron and hexavalent chromium,    respectively. Molecular simulations have been carried out for the   ground  state geometrical optimizations; bandgap is determined through   TDDFT  calculations using Gaussian software.
