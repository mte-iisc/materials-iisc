### Abstract:

Layered two-dimensional materials have attracted significant interest due to their unique electronic properties. In this talk, I will discuss the electrical transport properties of few-layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) showing insulator-to-metallic phase transition under applied electric field. Charge carrier mobility of a few layered ReS2 and MoSe2 FET devices increases as a function of decreasing temperature. Despite defects and impurities, evidence of a metallic state was observed at low temperature using an applied gate voltage or, equivalently, increasing the density of charge carriers within the 2D channel. We analyzed the conductivity data to explore the nature of the phase transition using temperature scaling analysis to distinguish the QPT and percolation nature of phase transition. In the second part of my talk, I will provide an overview of our recently developed high-density capacitive energy storage device on 2D nanofiller based dielectric polymer nanocomposites thin film capacitor where 2D fillers are placed in a stratified manner in the polymer matrix to improve the polarization and breakdown strength of the dielectric capacitors.
