Prof. K. T. Jacob has been selected to received the 2022 <a href="https://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/5975044/JWilliardGibbsGIBBS_Rules.pdf/28620908-4bb1-49b8-a764-83fd63c0ee94" target="_blank"><b>J. Willard Gibbs Equilibria Award</b></a> that is presented by the <a href="https://www.asminternational.org/home" target="_blank">American Society of Metals (ASM)</a> International. He has received this honor "for outstanding leadership in research and education in the area of thermodynamics and phase equilibria of metal and ceramic systems, encompassing innovation in experimental techniques and applications to materials processing". The award will be presented at the ASM Awards Dinner scheduled to take place during the <a href="https://www.asminternational.org/web/imat-2021/future-dates" target="_blank">International Materials, Applications and Technologies (IMAT) 2022</a> meeting.

The award was established in 2007 to recognize outstanding contributions to the field of Phase Equilibria. The award honors J. Willard Gibbs, one of Americaâ€™s greatest theoretical scientists. In addition to many other contributions, Gibbs laid the thermodynamic foundations of phase equilibria theory with his brilliant essay <a href="https://doi.org/10.2475/ajs.s3-16.96.441" target="_blank">"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances"</a> published in 1876 and 1878 in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy.
