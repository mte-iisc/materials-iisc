### Abstract:  

The simulation of the mechanical behavior of materials with internal structure, such as, for instance, composites or polycrystalline metals and ceramics, offers an avenue to (i) operate as a computational microscope to study behavior otherwise difficult to probe or observe, (ii) numerically test hypotheses about the constitutive material response, and, lastly, (iii) predict the behavior under complex boundary conditions provided the behavior is known and accurately described. DAMASK is a unified multi-physics crystal plasticity simulation package that was developed with above in mind. The “grid solver” included in DAMASK is particularly advantageous to simulate periodic (as well as non-periodic) volume elements that can encompass a representative or special microstructure of interest. A core feature of DAMASK is the flexibility in applicable constitutive laws for crystal plasticity. Next to purely mechanical problems, coupled problems including diffusion of heat and chemical species are addressable. Moreover, a concurrent phase-field damage model is available. This talk will outline the general hierarchical design of DAMASK that starts with solution strategies of the overall boundary value problem in purely mechanical settings and for coupled problems, possibilities for homogenization at the material point level and, at the lowest scale, constitutive description of crystal plasticity as well as other coupled material behavior. The second part of the talk presents a recent usage example of DAMASK in a study of how free surfaces influence slip activity in polycrystalline structures.
 
 
### Speaker Bio:
 
Professor Philip Eisenlohr holds a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from University Erlangen-Nuremberg (2004). In 2006, he relocated to the Max-Planck-Institute for Iron Research (now Sustainable Materials) to lead a research group on computational micro mechanics. In 2013, he joined the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at Michigan State University where he presently serves as Associate Chair. His research interests are in the general field of theoretical understanding and computational modeling of the mechanical behavior of microstructured materials. He is a founding developer and main contributor to the Düsseldorf Advanced Materials Simulation Kit (DAMASK), which is a versatile software framework originally devised to simulate crystal plasticity.
