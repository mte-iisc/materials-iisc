### Abstract:
The design of high entropy alloys (HEA) opened a new avenue of alloy development
almost two decades ago providing an abundant compositional space. The evolution in HEA
design from entropy-centric to phase-centric changed the focus from HEA to complex
concentrated alloys (CCAs) and displayed stability of either of three major phases namely
f.c.c., h.c.p. and b.c.c. solid solutions with minor presence of high entropy intermetallic phases in alloy microstructure. With time, the design philosophy of CCAs is termed differently such as equiatomic, eutectic, metastable, and flexible which mainly show synergistic use of
fundamental metallurgical principles with CCA theory for the design of respective alloys. In
line with that, the present work attempts the design of next-generation complex concentrated
alloys for four main categories of metals/alloys namely Fe, Ti, Cu, and Ni/Co based alloys.
The design of Fe containing HEA displayed multifunctionality by having five properties
(formability, strength-ductility synergy, fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, and electrical resistivity) better/comparable than its steel counterparts whereas Ti containing as-cast HEA for the first time revealed more than 50 % tensile elongation while having more than 90% compressive formability with an exceptional specific strength. Co and Ni containing HEA
showed remarkable high temperature oxidation resistance and specific strength at temperatures
greater than 800 Deg C in spite of the absence of any refractory element in the alloy whereas Cu
containing complex alloy demonstrated extreme strength-ductility synergy by two phases
strengthening as a result of prevalent spinodal decomposition in the alloy. Thus, current work
provides a new direction in designing future complex alloys and making them closer to use in
structural applications in a much cost-effective way.
