### Abstract: 

The miniaturization led advances in silicon-based electronics have revolutionized every socio-economic
sector through fast computing and communication. However, it is increasingly being felt that
miniaturization alone is insufficient as several emerging applications (e.g., interactive systems, wearables,
flexible displays etc.) require electronics in flexible form factors and seamlessly integrated onto soft
materials. The environmental impact of conventional micro/nanofabrication are also of increasing concern.
These applications and semiconductor manufacturing related demands call for new resource-efficient
methods to fabricate high-performance electronics on unconventional flexible and stretchable substrates.
This talk will present recent advances in this direction. In particular, the talk will focus on approaches such
as printed electronics based on high-mobility semiconducting nanostructures, ultra-thin chips for system in
foil, and hybrid or heterogenous integration of the off-the-shelf devices on soft substrates. The talk will also
cover innovative resource efficient methods such as roll transfer printing, contact printing and lithography
free printing etc., which are expected to transform the way electronics will be manufactured while serving
the emerging needs of applications such as robotics, wearables, healthcare and many more.
