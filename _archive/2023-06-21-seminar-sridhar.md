### Abstract: 
Mechanics research at IHPC focuses on application of mechanics from the atomic to continuum scales and integration across scales via multi-scale methods.  The tools include advanced computational methods such as phase‚Äêfield models, molecular dynamics, ab-initio, and Monte Carlo and span the traditional disciplines of physics, materials science, and applied mechanics.  In this talk, I highlight recent work in conducting virtual tests for materials, structures and manufacturing processes including a multi-physics framework for analysing the AM process, developing robust computational models for the cold spray repair process and for the micromechanics of deformation in multi-material composite architectures.
 
### Short Bio:                                                                                                                                                                       
Sridhar Narayanaswamy joined the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) in Aug 2011.  He is currently a Principal Scientist and Director of the Engineering Mechanics Division leading a research group to make advances in the mechanics of materials and structures with computational models, methodologies and algorithm development.  Prior to that, he was a senior scientist at Teledyne Imaging and Scientific (formerly Rockwell Science Center) in California.  His primary research interests include computational materials science and the deformation micromechanics of composite architectures. Sridhar obtained his Ph.D. in Materials Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and has authored 60+ research publications.
