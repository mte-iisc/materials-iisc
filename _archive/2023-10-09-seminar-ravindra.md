### Abstract of Talk:
The presentation highlights metal oxide-based High-k gate dielectric materials (e.g., ZrOx, AlOx) and semiconductors (IZTO, IGZTO, ZnO, doped-ZnO, CuGaSnSO), focusing on their applications in thin-film transistors (TFT) and low-cost, low power consumption Complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) for next-gen flexible displays. Also, Dr. Ravindra will talk about challenges like leakage current, hysteresis, stability under bias stress, and long-term environmental stability in solution- processed oxide TFTs.
