### Bio Data
Heena Khanchandani is currently working as a post-doctoral research scientist with Prof. Peter
Felfer in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Friedrich-Alexander-
University in Erlangen, Germany since October 2022. She is working on investigating the
hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of carbon austenitic steels. She graduated with a PhD in
August 2022 from the Max-Planck-Institute for Iron Research in Dusseldorf, Germany where
she worked in the Atom Probe Tomography group with Prof. Baptiste Gault. Her PhD thesis
was based on examining the hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms in a high-manganese
twinning induced plasticity steel by using correlative electron microscopy and atom probe
tomography. She has a Masters degree in Materials Science through Erasmus Mundus Masters
programme, thereby receiving joint Masters degree from two institutions: University of
Montpellier, France and Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany. She studied
Bachelor of Technology in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at Malaviya National
Institute of Technology Jaipur, India.

### Abstract:
High-manganese austenitic twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steels exhibit high strain
hardening, high tensile strength and ductility, which make them promising materials for
automotive and structural applications [1]. However, they are susceptible to oxidation [2] and
hydrogen embrittlement (HE) during service loading conditions [3]. We investigated the
influence of hydrogen on the dislocation structure in a model Fe-27Mn-0.3C (wt.%) TWIP
steel. We observed the microstructural evolution from the formation of dislocation cells at 3%
tensile strain to the formation of stacking faults at 7% tensile strain due to the presence of
hydrogen. The associated deformation mechanisms will be discussed during the talk. We also
investigated the mechanisms underpinning the oxidation and HE by atom probe tomography
where we measured the segregation of hydrogen and oxygen at grain boundaries. We studied
the role of carbon and manganese in the oxidation and HE susceptibility which are major
alloying elements in TWIP steels. This study motivated the design of a carbon austenitic steel
which has higher resistance to HE. The results on TWIP steel and the carbon austenitic steel
will be presented in details during this presentation.
