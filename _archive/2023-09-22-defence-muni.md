### Abstract
The studies are conducted to understand the effect of Re addition on  microstructural evolution and coarsening kinetics of new Co-Ni-= Al-Ti-Nb-Cr based superalloys. Lattice misfit is reduced with addition of Re, confirmed from high-resolution XRD. As a result, the  morphological transition from cuboidal to rounded cornered cubes with Re  addition is observed. Re solubility limit in the alloy is 3 at. %, and  excess Re promoted the formation of TCP phases. Through APT analysis, it  was found experimentally that there was no segregation of Re at the  / interface. With the addition of Re, the 0.2% proof strength is  retained up to 870°C with strength values greater than 650 MPa. However,  absence of yield strength anomaly (YSA) with Re is observed. 

 To understand the coarsening kinetics behavior of  precipitates in  the alloys, the study is conducted by isothermal treatment at t= emperatures of 900, 950 and 1000C for various time periods. By studying the temporal evolution of the following parameters during  coarsening, the interpretations are made, and the correlations are  established among precipitate size, PSD, lattice misfit, partitioning  coefficients, morphological evolution, volume fraction, and  micro-hardness. The rate constants (K) values for this class of alloys  are comparable and better than many existing superalloys. Additionally,  the activation energy for coarsening is estimated to be 260 and 240  kJ/mol, for addition of Re 2 and 3 at. %, respectively. 

 Pseudo-Binary diffusion couple approach is introduced to estimate the  interdiffusion coefficients in multicomponent system, in which only two  elements will participate in developing the composition profiles. The  same approach is examined for alloy designing and validated for recently  developed alloy system, Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Ta-Ti superalloy, in which effect of  Cr is considered. The heat treatment conditions are established to  transform the gradient of Cr in diffusion couple into corresponding  microstructural evolution. The following changes can evaluate through  diffusion couple method: morphological transition from cuboidal to  spherical, precipitate volume fraction, solubility limit of the Cr for  TCP phases, micro-hardness, elastic modulus, oxidation behavior (top  oxide grain morphology and layer thickness).
