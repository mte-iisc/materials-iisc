### Abstract
Pt-aluminide (PtAl) bond coat is used as a part of Thermal Barrier  Coating (TBC) system on Ni-base superalloy components in advanced gas  turbine aeroengines. The thickness of B2-NiAl intermetallic based  diffused coating varies in the range of 60-100 µm. The coating provides  excellent protection against oxidation to the superalloy components  experiencing extreme temperatures of 1000°C during the operation of  aeroengine. High temperatures combined with fluctuating mechanical loads  can induce fatigue damage in the coating during service. Damage  initiated in diffused coating propagates into the superalloy substrate  and causes failure of the components. Therefore, evaluation of  micro-mechanical properties of the PtAl bond coat is essential from the  scientific and engineering application standpoints. The present study  evaluates fatigue behavior of freestanding PtAl coating in the  temperature range of ambient to 1000°C. Testing of the coating in  freestanding form provides scientific understanding of inherent fatigue  behavior and the evolution of fatigue damage in the coating without any  influence from the substrate.
Detailed microstructural characterization of the fatigue tested coating  microsamples using SEM-EBSD, XRM and TEM has been carried out to  ascertain the fatigue damage mechanisms in the coating. In the  temperature regime of ambient to 800°C, high dislocation activity,  formation of dislocation cells and dislocation-precipitate interactions  induce strain hardening in the coating. The failure of the coating  occurs by the formation of micro-voids due to de-cohesion of  precipitate/B2-matrix interface in the heavily precipitated i= nterdiffusion zone (IDZ), subsequent formation of micro-cracks by coalescence of micro-voids, and final failure by propagation of  micro-cracks. On the other hand, the coating exhibits extensive voiding,  preferentially within its fine-grained outer layer, during fatigue  deformation at temperatures of 900°C and beyond. The voids in the outer  layer are primarily induced by creep. Cyclic loading leads to the  formation of microcracks from these voids, and final failure is caused  by the propagation of cracks. The deflection of crack across the coating  layers and blunting of the crack tip in the IDZ layer delay the fatigue  crack propagation.
