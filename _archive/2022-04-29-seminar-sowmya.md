### Abstract
Virtual screening of novel materials in an early stage of development is a key enabler of innovation in the chemical and process industries. This talk will introduce commonly used computational solutions for the design and screening of novel materials specifically using Siemens Simcenter Culgi software. As a case study, solubility and permeability of molecules will be discussed.

Some applications we are currently looking at include:

- Thermodynamic and rheological properties

- Interfacial phenomenon in surfactant innovation

- Self-assembly of polymers

- Prevention of phase separation of hydrogels

- Biologics formulations

- Ionic liquids properties for battery fuel cells
