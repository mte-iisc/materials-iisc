### Abstract
Metallic implants are crucial for osteosynthesis, aiming for effective  healing outcomes. These situations often demand patient-specific  treatments, as standard implants may not deliver expected functional  outcomes. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a promising solution by  enabling the fabrication of near-net shape parts. However, the  properties of AM-fabricated alloys differ significantly from  conventionally processed ones due to inherent high cooling rates and  thermal gradients during AM, thus altering the microstructural features.

 In this thesis, two different Ti alloys, namely Ti-6Al-4V ELI (α+β) and  Ti-35Nb-5Ta-7Zr (β) were investigated for biomedical applications,  particularly for load-bearing orthopedic implants. The first part of the  thesis is focused on applying cyclic heat treatment to modify the  microstructure of bone plates (prepared by selective laser melting, SLM)  from acicular martensite to bimodal, significantly enhancing  biomechanical performance, especially in bending. A comparison between  additively manufactured, heat-treated (HT), and wrought (WR) Ti-6Al-4V  ELI (Ti64) has been brought out, considering microstructural (including  texture), mechanical, electrochemical, and biological aspects. The study  revealed comparable biomechanical performance between additively  manufactured materials after heat treatment and wrought materials.  Subsequent fracture toughness evaluation indicated poorer values for AM  samples, showing strong anisotropy in crack initiation along the build  direction. However, heat treatment effectively improved fracture  toughness in both orientations. It has been observed that hard  orientations impede crack initiation, while twinning activity aids in  blunting crack tips and limiting propagation. Tribocorrosion  measurements revealed much more wear volume loss due to the synergistic  effect of wear and corrosion. The mechanism of tribocorrosion varied  depending on the testing conditions; wear was dominant under open  circuit potential (OCP) conditions, whereas wear-induced corrosion  prevailed under Potentiostatic conditions. The performance of HT samples  was significantly improved compared to wrought Ti64, as reported in the  literature.

 Building on these findings, patient-specific implants, biomechanically  improved post AM through heat treatment, were evaluated in human  subjects with upper limb complications, resulting in safe and effective  treatment for malunions and deformities, with reduced surgical time.  This constitutes the second part of the thesis.

 The last part is focused on developing an alloy with the composition  Ti-35Nb-5Ta-7Zr using directed energy deposition (DED) technique. Nearly  dense components exhibited complete β phase stability, lower elastic  modulus, strong crystallographic texture, high strength, good ductility,  excellent corrosion resistance, and cytocompatibility.

 Overall, the work presented in the thesis has important implications for  development and translation of additively manufactured Ti alloys for  orthopedic implants.
