### Abstract
The research seminar shall primarily focus on different aspects of material fabrication using metal additive manufacturing. The processing and suitable parameter optimisation of FeCo alloy by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is undertaken. Due to the high cooling rate during LPBF processing, the formation of the brittle B2 phase is suppressed producing FeCo alloys with an optimum combination of yield strength and elongation. The optimised processing parameters are used for defect-free fabrication of the rotor shaft of an electric motor. A novel material type fabricated using additive manufacturing is microarchitectured material. Here the development of Fe-3Si alloy micro-lattice structures using LPBF is taken. These micro-lattices find use in rotor shafts to reduce eddy current losses. Another aspect is to study the effect of microarchitecture on the shape memory behaviour of micro-lattices. The sample microarchitecture is observed to affect the shape memory response significantly. The application of biomimicry to metal additive manufacturing is also explored. Here the fabrication of cellular material is performed whose design is inspired by nature. Cellular materials inspired by honeycomb show layer-by-layer fracture behaviour during compression testing leading to higher compressive strength and elongation. Another bio-inspired cellular material is a nested solid whose architecture mimics a spider web. Here materials fabrication is undertaken which absorbs a lot of energy with minimal load transmission. The last part of the seminar shall briefly highlight the microstructural investigation of high Mn steel by electron microscopy. The study proved the deformation of ε- martensite during cold rolling.
