### Abstract
High-performance magnetometers capable of sub-nTesla detectability with reduced SWaP-C (size, weight, power and cost) are key towards building advanced human-machine interface sensors. To meet these objectives, Sonera has developed novel surface acoustic wave (SAW) based delay-line sensors that leverage the coupling between SAW and spin waves in a synthetic multiferroic heterostructure to create an extremely efficient method for energy transduction. In this sensing modality, termed acoustically-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ADFMR), a thin magnetic film strip is deposited between two pairs of lithographically patterned interdigital transducers, and is excited into resonance through elastic interactions with the travelling SAW. Any small external magnetic field will shift the magnetic film out of resonance, and alter the transmission characteristics of the SAW, allowing for very high sensitivity.
In this talk, I will examine the design considerations of the magnetoelectric layer for ADFMR based magnetometry, with particular emphasis on the growth and optimization of FeGaB based magnetostrictive thin films on yz-cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrates. I will conclude with examples of how the design and properties of the magnetoelectric layer impact the ADFMR device characteristics such as rf power absorption, sensitivity and the sensor’s limit of detection.
