### Abstract:
Steven Reddy is a structural geologist and geochronologist with research interests spanning large-scale tectonics to nanoscale material transfer processes. His expertise lies in the advanced characterization of geological materials, particularly high spatial resolution microstructural and microchemical analyses. This research has involved innovative integration of analytical techniques to understand material transfer processes. He pioneered the quantitative microstructural characterization of accessory phases by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and the integration of EBSD with high-spatial resolution geochemistry and geochronology in major and accessory phases. This has led to new ways of dating crustal deformation and the timing of meteorite impacts. He is currently working on the distribution and redistribution of trace elements in ore minerals and the how this knowledge may be used as to find giant ore deposits and improve the efficiency of precious metal extraction. He is currently the Science Leader of the Geoscience Atom Probe, an initiative to develop the geological applications of atom probe microscopy. In this area, he has been investigating the nanoscale characterisation of mineral deformation by the innovative integration of transmission EBSD and atom probe tomography. This work is leading to a new understanding of elemental transport via mineral defects during deformation.

### Research Interests
Steve's research interests include the relationship between rock deformation, geochemistry and isotope systematics; applications of quantitative microstructural analysis to Earth Sciences; rock deformation processes; exhumation of high-pressure rocks; evolution of orogenic systems (e.g. Alps, Capricorn, Usagaran) and Palaeoproterozoic Earth. Much of his research utilises advanced characterisation techniques including electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and atom probe tomography.
