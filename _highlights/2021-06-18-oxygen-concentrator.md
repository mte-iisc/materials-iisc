An indigenous Oxygen Concentrator was designed and developed in the Indian Institute of Science by a team led by <a href="https://materials.iisc.ac.in/~praveen/" target="_blank">Prof. Praveen Ramamurthy</a>. This prototype delivers more than 95% oxygen at 1 liter per minute and reaches this higher limit within 3 minutes of the start of the system.  At 5 lpm, greater than 93±3% and at 10 lpm 85 % oxygen is generated.  The stability of the system was monitored by continuous operation for more than 8 months.

Clinical trail is complete with a report concluding that this system is as good as compressed oxygen cylinders. Up to now technology transfer is complete to 18 companies and few more in the pipeline.
