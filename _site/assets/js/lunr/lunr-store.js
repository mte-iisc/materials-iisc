        "title": "“Materials Design: From Grain Boundary Mobilities to Additive Manufacturing”  (09/02/21)",
        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. Peter Voorhees   Frank C. Engelhart  Professor of Materials Science and Engineering   Northwestern University  Illinois, USA    When?  9th February, 2021 (Tuesday), 08:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The classical method for designing materials to achieve certain performance goals involves a laborious procedure wherein intuition drives the design of a material that is then created and tested. In most cases, the performance goals are not achieved, and this costly procedure is repeated. By integrating data, computations, and artificial intelligence it is possible to break this expensive cycle and bring innovative new materials to the marketplace faster and at a lesser expense. The materials design process requires links between processing conditions and the resulting microstructure. We illustrate an approach to coupling the processing conditions of additive manufacturing (AM) to microstructure. A phase field model has been developed that follows the evolution of thousands of grains in three dimensions as a heat source propagates along a surface at the high rates seen during AM. Through this approach it is possible to determine the effects of the solidification conditions, the weld pool geometry, and multiple passes of the heat source on the resulting grain morphology. We also discuss a new method for determining difficult-to-measure materials parameters (data needed for design), in this case grain boundary mobilities. The mobility of grain boundaries is thought to be determined by the crystallography of the adjacent crystals. Through a direct comparison of a three-dimensional experimental movie to simulations of the evolution of 1500 grains in iron we have determined over 1600 reduced grain boundary mobilities. We find that the reduced mobilities vary by three orders of magnitude and exhibit no correlation with the boundary crystallography. This implies that factors other than crystallography set grain boundary mobilities. This brings new challenges to predicting the kinetics of grain growth in polycrystalline materials.

Using first-principles theoretical analysis, we predict ferroelectricity in 2-D materials like 1T-MoS2 and h-NbN, and demonstrate how it originates from strongly coupled electrons and phonons. While these allow dipolectronic devices based on ultimately thin active channels, experimental realization of such devices and their scalable fabrication are quite challenging. To this end, we report scale-free ferroelectricity in which sub-nano meter thin ferroelectric layers are naturally embedded in 2-dimensional crystalline architecture of orthorhombic structure of HfO2, a material that is already a part of current semiconductor technologies, opening up ultimately high density ferroelectric memory devices.

Ordered intermetallic precipitates are generally resistant to shearing by dislocations, resulting in strengthening, but are also effective for damage tolerance since they will ultimately deform plastically in the presence of high local stresses.  Ni-base superalloys are prototypical examples wherein L12 precipitates strengthen the solid solution nickel alloy matrix to high fractions of melting.  The contribution of precipitate shearing to overall plasticity in Ni-base alloys has to date been assessed via post-deformed transmission electron microscopy studies of mechanically deformed samples.  We report here on a novel in-situ approach to studying precipitate shearing and faulting in superalloys.   This approach integrates MEMs straining stages with a STEM detector in the SEM, enabling dynamic observations of defects and their interactions with precipitates, faults and boundaries, studied with diffraction contrast.  New insights on the frequency of shearing and the faulting mechanisms will be reported and the implications for alloy design will be discussed.     ","categories": [],

G. M. Michell, Gustave Eiffel, and more. Investigations into topology optimization of structures in the last three decades makes us wonder how optimal structures were conceived before mathematical and computational tools were available. In this talk, we begin with the ideas of Maxwell and Michell and discuss how gradient-based topology optimization is used today with a standard template of design parameterization and adjoint sensitivity analysis.   ‘Material interpolation’, which is the key idea in topology optimization, will be discussed in the context of Multiphysics problems in structures and compliant mechanisms. A few examples of both will be presented in this talk. Architects too are embracing topology optimization. A passing reference will be made to the aesthetics in structural design following the ideas of M. C. Escher.   There has been a recent surge of interest in this field due to emerging additive manufacturing. This connects topology optimization of structures to ‘metamaterial design’. A natural extension of this is simultaneous optimization of structures and materials. Towards this, the talk will conclude with ongoing efforts in the design of fiber-reinforced structures and lattice structures with anisotropy and heterogeneity to achieve optimality.
