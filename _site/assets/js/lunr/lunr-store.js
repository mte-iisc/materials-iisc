Using first-principles theoretical analysis, we predict ferroelectricity in 2-D materials like 1T-MoS2 and h-NbN, and demonstrate how it originates from strongly coupled electrons and phonons. While these allow dipolectronic devices based on ultimately thin active channels, experimental realization of such devices and their scalable fabrication are quite challenging. To this end, we report scale-free ferroelectricity in which sub-nano meter thin ferroelectric layers are naturally embedded in 2-dimensional crystalline architecture of orthorhombic structure of HfO2, a material that is already a part of current semiconductor technologies, opening up ultimately high density ferroelectric memory devices.

        "title": "Materials Design: From Grain Boundary Mobilities to Additive Manufacturing  (09/02/21)",
        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. Peter Voorhees   Frank C. Engelhart  Professor of Materials Science and Engineering   Northwestern University  Illinois, USA    When?  9th February, 2021 (Tuesday), 08:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The classical method for designing materials to achieve certain performance goals involves a laborious procedure wherein intuition drives the design of a material that is then created and tested. In most cases, the performance goals are not achieved, and this costly procedure is repeated. By integrating data, computations, and artificial intelligence it is possible to break this expensive cycle and bring innovative new materials to the marketplace faster and at a lesser expense. The materials design process requires links between processing conditions and the resulting microstructure. We illustrate an approach to coupling the processing conditions of additive manufacturing (AM) to microstructure. A phase field model has been developed that follows the evolution of thousands of grains in three dimensions as a heat source propagates along a surface at the high rates seen during AM. Through this approach it is possible to determine the effects of the solidification conditions, the weld pool geometry, and multiple passes of the heat source on the resulting grain morphology. We also discuss a new method for determining difficult-to-measure materials parameters (data needed for design), in this case grain boundary mobilities. The mobility of grain boundaries is thought to be determined by the crystallography of the adjacent crystals. Through a direct comparison of a three-dimensional experimental movie to simulations of the evolution of 1500 grains in iron we have determined over 1600 reduced grain boundary mobilities. We find that the reduced mobilities vary by three orders of magnitude and exhibit no correlation with the boundary crystallography. This implies that factors other than crystallography set grain boundary mobilities. This brings new challenges to predicting the kinetics of grain growth in polycrystalline materials.

Ordered intermetallic precipitates are generally resistant to shearing by dislocations, resulting in strengthening, but are also effective for damage tolerance since they will ultimately deform plastically in the presence of high local stresses.  Ni-base superalloys are prototypical examples wherein L12 precipitates strengthen the solid solution nickel alloy matrix to high fractions of melting.  The contribution of precipitate shearing to overall plasticity in Ni-base alloys has to date been assessed via post-deformed transmission electron microscopy studies of mechanically deformed samples.  We report here on a novel in-situ approach to studying precipitate shearing and faulting in superalloys.   This approach integrates MEMs straining stages with a STEM detector in the SEM, enabling dynamic observations of defects and their interactions with precipitates, faults and boundaries, studied with diffraction contrast.  New insights on the frequency of shearing and the faulting mechanisms will be reported and the implications for alloy design will be discussed.     ","categories": [],

G. M. Michell, Gustave Eiffel, and more. Investigations into topology optimization of structures in the last three decades makes us wonder how optimal structures were conceived before mathematical and computational tools were available. In this talk, we begin with the ideas of Maxwell and Michell and discuss how gradient-based topology optimization is used today with a standard template of design parameterization and adjoint sensitivity analysis.   ‘Material interpolation’, which is the key idea in topology optimization, will be discussed in the context of Multiphysics problems in structures and compliant mechanisms. A few examples of both will be presented in this talk. Architects too are embracing topology optimization. A passing reference will be made to the aesthetics in structural design following the ideas of M. C. Escher.   There has been a recent surge of interest in this field due to emerging additive manufacturing. This connects topology optimization of structures to ‘metamaterial design’. A natural extension of this is simultaneous optimization of structures and materials. Towards this, the talk will conclude with ongoing efforts in the design of fiber-reinforced structures and lattice structures with anisotropy and heterogeneity to achieve optimality.

One important drawback of these steels is a continuous cyclic softening; i.e. they lose strength continuously under strain-controlled cyclic loading. This is mostly attributed to the instability of their tempered martensitic structure. To overcome this shortcoming, a small amount of highly stable nano-oxide particles can be distributed into their matrix in order to form so-called oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels. This not only improves high-temperature tensile properties and creep resistance, but also assists in mitigating undesirable cyclic softening at elevated temperatures. Another critical concern for structural materials that undergo cyclic loading is slip localization. Cyclic slip localization starts early in the fatigue life and manifests in the form of distinct dislocation structures formation such as persistent slip bands (PSBs). PSBs are typically related to the formation of extrusions and intrusions, where fatigue cracks are known nucleate. Taking two complexconcentrated alloys as materials system examples, cyclic slip localization is shown to be mitigated by altering stacking-fault energy. Furthermore, for high temperature applications, oxide dispersion strengthening is also successfully employed  ","categories": [],

The understanding of the material physics embodied by chemistryprocessing-structure-property correlation falls short due to the rapid developments in these fields. In this talk, I will discuss microstructural evolution during advanced manufacturing processes like Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Processing parameters during laser based additive manufacturing affect the fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification characteristics in the melt pool, leading to microstructural variants of texture, grain size, and morphology. A finite volume based Computational Fluid Dynamics model coupled with solidification physics has been developed to predict melting, flow, solidification, and resulting microstructural characteristics during such processes. The variation of texture, grain size and columnar/equiaxed morphology of the grains with laser power and speed has been verified against experiments. The difference in cooling curves and evolution of temperature gradients and cooling rates during solidification leading to a difference in each microstructural variant has been identified. Lower laser power and higher scan rates lead to “unconstrained” solidification with small variation of solidification times across the melt pool depth leading to finer grain structure with lower grain boundary misorientations. On the other hand, higher power and lower scan rates lead to “constrained” solidification, with huge variations in solidification times, coarser grains and highly misoriented grain boundaries. Hunt’s criterion-based processing maps for understanding the morphological variants has been prepared for systematic design of microstructure during the SLM process. In the next part, I will briefly present my work on a robust multiscale computational approach to design electrochemical materials for Solid Oxide Fuel/Electrolyzer Cells (SOF/EC). The depletion of fossil fuels and rapidly deteriorating ‘global warming’ situation with climate change has created a demand for the greener and renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Understanding the electrochemical characteristics of materials used for these technologies is the first step towards material design. The prediction of electrochemical characteristics for protonconducting Yttrium doped Barium Zirconate based SOF/EC, using a multiscale framework combining physics at the atomistic, meso, and continuum scales will be discussed. I will also talk about uncertainty quantification and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and random forest to optimize chemistry for different temperatures and atmospheres for pure/doped perovskites. These projects provide new scientific insights and demonstrate the possible application of the introduced methodology for virtual certification of the next generation of high-performance materials and manufactured products.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. R. Balamuralikrishnan   Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL)   Hyderabad    When?  21th September, 2021 (Thursday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  High performance steels deliver excellent performance for rather critical applications that have stringent, often conflicting, property requirements. Steels for naval structural applications are subject to one of the harshest operating environments, with constant exposure to sea water, various types of static and dynamic loading, and large variation in temperatures. These steels are required to possess necessary ambient temperature strength (minimum yield strength: 390 to 800MPa for different variants) and excellent low temperature impact toughness (~ 80J minimum, at minus 40o C or even minus 60o C). Apart from these, they are also expected to have good weldability and adequate corrosion resistance. For over two decades, DMRL has been actively working in the development/indigenization of low alloy steels for naval applications with yield strengths of about 400MPa to about 800MPa, which are required to have impact toughness in excess of 80J at -40o C. Our efforts have spanned the entire spectrum from lab scale scientific studies to industrial scale production and certification for final use. Given the application, large sheets/plates, in widths ranging from 1.5 to 3m, and in lengths well in excess of 6m, constitute the bulk of the requirement. Thus, while studies at lab scale involve melts of 30-50kg, industrial production involves melts of 50 tonnes or more! The talk will provide a few examples from our work spanning the entire range from the developmental phase to the industrial production phase. Special emphasis will be given to illustrating how (lab-scale) R&amp;D was employed to address challenges that arose during bulk production in order to improve product reliability and consistency     ","categories": [],

Bacterial nanocellulose may prove to be one of the most promising green materials of modern times due to its advantages over plant cellulose, including high purity, good water absorption, strong water retention, high tensile strength, good biocompatibility and biodegradability Based on these characteristics, BNC has been widely used in many areas such as electronics, biomedicine, food industry and energy storage. It is also used in foods such as multifunctional food ingredients to control the properties of food or beverage as a thickener, stabilizer and texture modifier. In the biomedical field, BNC is widely studied as a highly biocompatible raw material for wound healing, artificial blood vessels, and tissue engineering. We have demonstrate by using indigenously isolated an alternative bacterium different than model organisms.

Abstract  Microstructures of materials are known to play a significant role in determining the effective properties of materials as well as their elasto-plastic response in terms of the ability to deform plastically to large strains without the onset of plastic instability and fracture. This has significance in terms of better understanding of material behavior of existing commercial alloys leading to their microstructure optimization as well as development of new alloys. Much experimental effort is being made towards developing techniques that are newer, faster, more accurate, and involve larger material volumes at smaller scales of precipitates and other constituent particles in the matrix. Additional effort is being made towards creating virtual microstructures that can efficiently and closely resemble real microstructures using statistical methods and stereological relationships. Lastly, microstructure-based finite element methodologies are being advanced to study large plastic deformation behavior of structural metallic materials for automotive forming applications. The talk would briefly review the smaller-scale particle characterization effort for structural metallic materials in the literature and then focus on the effort being made at McMaster towards (i) particle characterization of two different automotive aluminum sheet materials by statistical and FIB/SEM based experimental methods, and (ii) incorporation of particles microstructure into finite element models for studying their role in governing plastic flow, damage development, and fracture.

An aging global population is accelerating the need for better, longer-lasting implants. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to fabricate patient-specific, titanium-alloy-based implants with tailored, three-dimensional, bone-like pores and internal surfaces for forming new bone for superior integration. However, a stubborn barrier remains. Most of the implants developed by additive manufacturing technologies involve melting the materials by high energy beam, thereby increasing the operational cost for maintaining inert environment especially with reactive metals like titanium, magnesium and their alloys. In this talk, I will cover two stories, firstly, green fabrication, one the best alternative routes as there are absence of significant thermal gradients and associated stresses during printing, avoidance of solidification-induced defects, lower oxygen contamination, and lower printing cost. The second part, I will discuss the methods to improve interfacial bonding of the implants. Current line-of-sight clinical methods enhance osseointegration but can’t reach all internal surfaces of porous implants. I will present a non-line-of-sight, gas/solid-reaction-based process that is capable of generating well-controlled nanotopographies on all open (gasexposed) surfaces of these implants. Overall, this research will demonstrate simple, user friendly and cost-effective route for developing titanium implants/equivalents with enhanced interfacial bonding for load bearing functional implant applications.

Annamalai   Australian Institute for Bioengineering &amp; Nanotechnology,   The University of Queensland,    St Lucia, Queensland,    Australia, 4072    When?  3rd December, 2021 (Friday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Nanocellulose is a versatile functional nanomaterial, and it can be derived from all the lignocellulose biomass, marine animals and through bacterial engineering. It has a potential to be utilised in plethora of advance engineering applications, from both the sustainability perspectives (economy, environment and society) and new functionalities that can offer. In 2012, we have discovered that a long and thin nanofibres can be isolated from an Australian native arid grass spinifex and found that this nanocellulose can retain the cell wall constituents hemicellulose and lignin. This results in effortless fibrillation, and consequently, the cost-effective production of excellent longer and more flexible nanofibres. This unique combination opens an opportunity for tunability in residual lignocellulosic composition, morphology and the physical and mechanical properties with high product yield, through various chemical pre-treatments and surface modifications. Since the discovery, we have explored the use of spinifex nanocellulose in various applications for various industry sectors and found some limitations and challenges. This presentation will give an overview of our team’s translational research activities in clever applications including ultrathin dipped elastomer products, polymer composites, recycling papers and cementitious materials.   The presentation will also be extended on the strategies for improving sustainability and performance of rigid polyurethane foam for insulation applications, which is the research area I developed at UQ. Insulation is a cost-effective solution for saving energy in in space conditioning and appliances applications, is the need for the hour and rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) based insulation materials have gained an increased attention for their versatility, processibility and achievable physical properties (high compressive strength, low thermal conductivity) at low-density regime. Our research focuses on achieving sustainability and performance of RPUF insulation materials through systematic incorporation of biomass-derived precursors and nanomaterial additives. The presentation will demonstrate different strategies of thermal insulation and mechanical performance using palm oil (as a reactive polyol) and rod-like cellulose nanocrystals (CNC as nucleating agent), and an industrial grade lignin (as a reactive filler).

We continually interact with computational, memory, and imaging devices where a large number of electrons are pushed around various defect states at every nanosecond inside semiconductors. As these technologies are evolving rapidly from traditional circuit boards to flexible electronics, new materials, physics, and processing technologies are being explored to improve their functionality and efficiency. This brings unique experimental challenges to evaluate fundamentally the interaction of defects with electrons in novel semiconducting materials. In this presentation, I will first discuss a prototypical MIS capacitive device architecture to illustrate the electron trapping in non-volatile memory devices fabricated using low temperature processed oxide material. Unlike the conventional measurement technique, I will then describe the challenges in measuring the defects in non-conventional semiconductor materials and my approach of probing defects. In the later part, I will demonstrate a high-speed capacitance measurement system to probe the defect states in solution processed oxide materials. Finally, I will explain the major advantage of this measurement system in terms of eliminating the contribution of substrate or interface defect states. Thus new measurement system paves the way for characterizing the semiconductor materials for industrial applications.   ","categories": [],

In this regard, thermoelectric materials and devices have drawn increasing interest and attention due to their potential to convert waste heat into fruitful electricity. [1] A dimensionless figure of merit quantifies the thermoelectric material’s efficiency, zT = S 2σT/k where S, σ, T and k are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature and total thermal conductivity (sum of the electronic part, ke and the lattice part, klatt) respectively. The fact that these thermoelectric transport properties are highly interrelated throws a more significant challenge in enhancing zT. However, advances in recent times show that it is feasible to improve zT by a number of approaches: electronic band convergence, fostering resonance states near the Fermi level, quantum confinement of charge carriers, nestification, electron filtering effect, dimensionality reduction, modulating light bands with a low effective mass, deformation potential coefficient, and nanostructuring, which includes the engineering of nanoscale defects (dislocations, stacking faults, point defects, and nanopores), and multiscale hierarchical architecting, imparting rattling impurities, intrinsic bond/strong lattice anharmonicities, etc.[2] The presentation shall highlight some of these approaches that we have effectively applied on various kinds of materials, ranging from glasses and ceramics to several types of polycrystalline compounds (materials based on tellurides, sulfides, and oxides); different synthesis and processing techniques, right from traditional melt processing to advanced flash-spark plasma sintering; distinct approaches like dopant induced glass crystallization, composition engineering, nanostructuring, electronic band structure engineering, lattice softening, etc., to enhance the thermoelectric performance.[3–8] The presentation shall also touch upon our attempts to find thermoelectric materials for potential application at different operating ranges of temperature.

To control the performance of 2D materials, many methods have been proposed, including physical and chemical ways, to manipulate the electronic, atomic, and microscopic properties.

Recently, the earth-abundant semiconductor materials (binary, ternary and quaternary) have drawn major interests as viable candidate to boost the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells. Effective commercialization of solar cells hinges on the low-cost scaled up synthesis approaches along with cost-effective device fabrication techniques. Earth-abundant semiconductor materials have shown a great potential for these synthesis methods and the thin-film technology with portable deposition techniques has proven to be the most cost-effective route for solar cell fabrication. These materials have attracted substantial attention due to their non-toxicity, low-cost potential, direct band gap commensurate with optical absorption in the visible range and high absorption coefficient (&gt;104 cm-1). Thorough atomic-level insights about the fundamental properties of the interfaces and mechanisms underlying the interfacial phenomena are immensely desirable, which aids in the fabrication of high-quality and structurally ordered junctions for efficient photovoltaic applications. The understanding about the band alignment and the related properties at the interfaces is of paramount importance as it directly affects the device performance. Several of our recent studies focused on band alignment engineering for a clear understanding of the concurrent carrier transport mechanism at heterointerface. The facile synthesis, cost-effective deposition, and fundamental insights about the band-alignment provide a promising approach for fabrication of next-generation solar cells with earth-abundant light-absorbing materials.

However, high processing/annealing temperature (≥600°C) involved in the fabrication of thin/thick films causes the electrical breakdown of the films and also prevents their deposition on flexible, and metallic substrates. The thin/thick films of ferroelectrics at lower temperatures can be fabricated by (1) laser-induced crystallization (LIC) technique using an excimer laser (&lt;300oC) (2) aerosol deposition (AD) method at room temperature and (3) photon-assisted flash annealing technique. We have successfully demonstrated a way to crystallize Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (BST) thin films at a lower temperature of ~300°C by an alternating depositing and annealing process using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. At first, the BST thin film with a thickness of ~120 nm was deposited (laser energy of ~2 J/cm2) and subsequently laser annealed (66 mJ/cm2) at 300°C with several repetitions. Similarly, the aerosol deposition (AD) technique was employed to fabricate the thick films of PLZT ceramics (relaxor and anti-ferroelectric) at room temperature. The grain sizes of the AD thick films were tuned by thermal annealing which in turn can tune the electrical properties. The PLZT AD thick films showed excellent energy-storage density with stable energy efficiency which is required for commercial applications. Recently, photonics-based annealing using a xenon flash lamp has been successfully demonstrated for the annealing of metal oxide films on metal or polymer substrates fabricated by using PLD and AD. This photon-assisted flash annealing technique can be employed to realize flexible triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators, magneto-mechano-electric (MME) generators, magnetic field sensors, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS), and micro-actuators.

Group,  Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Metrology (CAMM),  CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute   &amp;    Associate Professor, AcSIR (CMERI campus)   When?  20th December, 2021 (Monday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Those who are unable to attend the meeting at lecture theatre, can attend the same using the below Teams link.   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  1. Semi solid casting of Al alloys and Al matrix composites to develop prototype Automobile components    Semi solid casting (employing gravity and pressure die casting techniques) enables manufacturing of near net shaped automobile, aircraft and marine components with better mechanical and tribological properties and with better dimensional accuracy. Better strength to weight ratio of semi solid cast Aluminium alloy and Aluminium matrix composite based auto components causes reduced fuel consumption and reduced green house gas emission.  The present work discusses the development of process technology of Rheo pressure die casting (RPDC) and Rheo gravity die casting (RGDC) of Al alloys and Al matrix composites. In case of RPDC, A cooling slope made of stainless steel has been employed for semi solid slurry generation, followed by isothermal holding of the generated slurry in a resistance heating furnace and transferring it in metered quantity to the shot sleeve of high pressure die casting machine, to develop automotive knuckle housing (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra) as a prototype component out of A356 Al alloy. Whereas, Rheo gravity die casting process technology has been employed to develop light weight automobile components out of in-house developed novel Al-15Mg2Si-4.5Si composite with notably improved mechanical properties and structural integrity. Automobile Brake disc (Tata Indica) has been developed as a prototype component out of the above mentioned composite. Thereafter, the developed composite is processed using a high pressure die casting machine at liquid and semi solid state to develop prototype connecting rod (TVS), targeting two wheeler engine applications.   2. Design and Development of Tooth colored dental (Orthodontic) brackets    Dental brackets, scientifically known as orthodontic brackets, are used for correction of irregular and deformable teeth of the people by applying continuous pressure on the teeth to slowly move the teeth in a specific direction over a period of time, which helps to make proper teeth alignment. Out of the options available, ceramic brackets offer significantly better mechanical properties, increased transparency and decreased reactivity with the oral environment compared to their metallic and plastic counterparts.  In spite of costlier translucent alumina (ceramic) dental brackets available in the market, which are imported in our country, in the present work, affordable net shape Tooth coloured alumina dental brackets have been developed for a comparable cost with their metallic counterparts, employing Micro Ceramic Injection Moulding (µ-CIM) process technology, for the first time in the country. It should be noted here that, apart from processing technique, the novelty lies in the design aspect as well. Design modifications are incorporated within the developed brackets, in view of ease of manufacturing and to achieve cost efficiency. The developed brackets are found to be of low cost, tooth colored appearance, possessing improved hardness, bio compatibility and improved debonding strength. The above mentioned attributes qualifies their suitability for possible societal deployment.   ","categories": [],

RANGANATHAN Distinguished Lecture Series”   About Prof. S. Ranganathan:  Professor Srinivasa Ranganathan is the NASI Platinum Jubilee Fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore . His academic career as an educator and researcher in metallurgy at Banaras Hindu University and the Indian Institute of Science during the last four decades has been exceptional. He has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure of interfaces, quasicrystals, bulk metallic glasses, and nanostructured materials. He has co-authored three books with Alan Mackay and Eric Lord on New Geometries for New Materials, Legendary Wootz Steel with Sharada Srinivasan, and high-entropy alloys with Profs. B.S. Murty and Yeh. He worked together with metallurgical legends such as Professor T.R. Anantharaman, Prof. Alan Cottrell, and Prof Gareth Thomas. This had a profound influence on not just his life, but also on the subject of multicomponent alloys. “The search for structure continues, and I mainly rely on geometric intuition. I visited higher-dimensional space. In archaeo- metallurgy, I traveled back in time to distant lands in antiquity.”, he says in his article on “A search for structure with travels in space and time.” He is a teacher par excellence and has inspired students throughout his teaching career and changed the life of every student, who came in contact with him.   Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. J.W. Yeh  NTHU, Taiwan   When?  10th January, 2022 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Since ancient times, there has been an unbreakable myth in the manufacture of materials: it is believed that adding more kinds of alloying elements in high proportions would render the alloy brittle and useless. To break the myth, “high-entropy alloys” was proposed in 2004 and defined as having at least five major elements. The name emphasized the high entropy effect which enhances multi-principal elements in a composition to form solid solutions. Severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion and cocktail effects also accompany the alloy by affecting microstructure and properties. Now, the high entropy composition concept has been extended to ceramics, polymers and organics. Medium-entropy materials are also activated and researched. Therefore, the elemental periodic table has a new life providing unlimited compositions and properties. This talk briefly summarizes the four core effects and describes the applied technology of high- entropy materials in industry.   About the Speaker:  Prof. J.W. Yeh is a Distinguished Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. He is the first to propose the concept of HEAs and HE-related materials. He has been researching this topic for almost 19 years. From 2004 until the present, he has published more than 240 SCI papers, including at least 180 on high-entropy materials. He defined and named the new alloys; proposed four fundamental effects and established fundamental principles; extended the concept to ceramics and polymers; and paved the way for newcomers by demonstrating the feasibility, phenomena, and potential of high-entropy materials via casting, wrought, powder metallurgy, and coating routes. At ICHEM-2018, the conference’s steering committee elected him Chair of the International High Entropy Materials Consortium. Additionally, he has over 25,760 citations and an H-index of 69. (Web of science). Additionally, he holds at least 40 patents.  ","categories": [],

It is found that an increase in the Cr/Ni ratio stabilizes the topologically close-packed σ-phase and accelerates its precipitation kinetics [4], which is also enhanced by a decrease in mean grain size. By analyzing the temporal evolutions of the concentration profiles forming at FCC/σ interfaces and the dimensions of σ-phase precipitates, the diffusion processes responsible for the precipitation kinetics were identified [5]. As the σ-phase is known to cause embrittlement in austenitic alloys, its influence on tensile properties was investigated. Overall, this work not only sheds light on the factors affecting the long-term stability of HEAs from the Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni system and the precipitation kinetics of secondary phases, but it also motivates the investigation of other HEAs that are considered for applications at high temperatures.

However, it was only in the last five decades that the science of sintering was perfected. More recently, the addition of electric field-assisted sintering has led to ultrafast sintering and achieving improved properties compared to conventional sintering. In this subset of sintering processes, flash-sintering has emerged as a rather distinctive processing route due to the simplicity of the process and flexibility in scale-up. While the scientific engagement of flash sintering saw an exponential increase in the last few years, it is now being applied to processes beyond sintering. These include reactive flash-sintering, where two components are co-flashed to result in a non-equilibrium phase stabilization, the touch-free sintering, where the boundaries of electricity-induced sintering are pushed towards complex shape sintering, and the possibility of graphene infusion by flash, to name a few states of art developments in the flash. It’s speculated that most, if not all, of these distinctive properties are possible due to the existence of a solid-state plasma during the Stage III of the flash. I am looking forward to discussing these developments with you in the upcoming talk.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Vikram Gavini  Department of Mechanical Engineering,  Department of Materials Science and Engineering,  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor   When?  12th April, 2022 (Tuesday), 10:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  Electronic structure calculations, especially those using density functional theory (DFT), have been very useful in understanding and predicting a wide range of materials properties. The importance of DFT calculations to engineering and physical sciences is evident from the fact that ~20% of computational resources on some of the world’s largest public supercomputers are devoted to DFT calculations. Despite the wide adoption of DFT, and the tremendous progress in theory and numerical methods over the decades, the following challenges remain. Firstly, the state-of-the-art implementations of DFT suffer from cell-size and geometry limitations, with the widely used codes in solid state physics being limited to periodic geometries and typical simulation domains containing a few hundred atoms. This limits the complexity of materials systems that can be treated using DFT calculations. Secondly, there are many materials systems (such as strongly-correlated systems) for which the widely used model exchange-correlation functionals in DFT, which account for the many-body quantum mechanical interactions between electrons, are not satisfactory. Addressing these challenges will enable large-scale quantum-accuracy DFT calculations, and can significantly advance our ab initio modeling capabilities to treat complex materials systems.   This talk will discuss our recent advances towards addressing the aforementioned challenges. In particular, the development of computational methods and numerical algorithms for conducting fast and accurate large-scale DFT calculations using adaptive finite-element discretization will be presented, which form the basis for the open-source DFT-FE code. The computational efficiency, scalability and performance of DFT-FE will be presented, which demonstrates a significant outperformance of widely used plane-wave DFT codes. Some recent studies that highlight the capabilities of DFT-FE will be presented, which include: (i) studies on dislocation energetics in Magnesium; (ii) understanding the electronic structure underpinnings of electron transport in DNA molecules. In addressing the second challenge, our recent breakthrough in accurately solving the inverse DFT problem will be presented, which has enabled the computation of exact exchange-correlation potentials for polyatomic systems. Ongoing efforts on using the exact exchange-correlation potentials to develop a data-driven approach for improving the exchange-correlation functional description in DFT will be discussed.

Constitutive models for the flow strength as a function of strain, strain rate, pressure, and temperature are needed to model and simulate applications. This talk focuses on the behavior of iron at high strain rates using a split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar (SHPB) and at high pressures using the pressure shear plate impact (PSPI) technique. A shear-compression specimen (SCS) used to attain high strain rates, large strains, and shear dominant deformation provides a seamless characterization of a-iron over a range of strain rates, 10-4 to 2x104 s-1. In addition to the mechanical response (stress-strain), a high-speed infrared detector is used to measure in-situ temperature rise during dynamic deformation. Strong strain rate sensitivity of flow stress is observed, with strengths exceeding 1 GPa, comparable to pre-shocked iron and high strength steels. The microstructural evolution characterized using optical, SEM, TEM, and EBSD provides insights into the strengthening and deformation mechanisms.  Results from PSPI experiments on iron at pressures ranging from 10 to 43 GPa and strain rates ~105 s-1 are presented. The mechanical response of the low pressure a phase (bcc) and the high-pressure e phase (hcp) is obtained, with the a to e transformation occurring at ~13 GPa. A strong pressure hardening in strength is observed, and the possible mechanisms for the hardening are discussed.   ","categories": [],

She did her B.S. from the department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, METU (Ankara, Turkey). Thereafter, she received her PhD. from the Iowa state University (AMES lab), in Materials Science and Engineering, followed by a post-doc at CNRS - UPMC, Paris Nanoscience Institute (INSP), Paris, FRANCE, where she worked on a project with the French space agency. Prof. Serofoglu experience lies in conducting controlled in-situ solidification experiments and studying spontaneous pattern formation/microstructure evolution in multi-phase systems.   When?  27th April, 2022 (Wednesday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Mode  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The cooperative or diffusively coupled growth of multiple phases during solidification is one of the most widely observed and generally important classes of phase transformations in materials. Technologically, due to having lower melting points compared with their pure components, and small freezing ranges, these alloys have excellent fluidity exhibited during casting and favorable properties offered by the fine composite structures both of which contribute to the wide application of eutectic alloys in the casting, welding, soldering, and additive manufacturing of engineered components. Academically, the topic of eutectic solidification offers a wealth of rich problems involving multicomponent thermodynamics, solid-liquid and solid-solid interfacial phenomena, morphological stability, chemical and thermal diffusion, and nucleation phenomena. Surprisingly, despite the broad-based technological and academic importance, many fundamental questions regarding eutectic solidification remain unanswered. This lack of understanding severely limits our ability to employ computational methods in the prediction of microstructure for the effective design of new materials and processing techniques through simulation.   In this study, we address critical questions regarding microstructure selection in three-phase eutectic systems in the presence of crystal/crystal anisotropy. Real-time directional solidification and rotating directional solidification experiments were performed on In-Bi-Sn model alloy to characterize different grain types in three-phase systems. It is shown that while lamellar ABAC pattern is preserved during RDS of an isotropic eutectic grain, both the phase arrangement and the morphologies of phases could be altered in the presence of interphase boundary anisotropy. Diverse classes of three-phase eutectic grains are identified and analyzed. It is shown that the formation of these grains is a function of the intrinsic properties of the interphase boundaries, rather than experimental parameters. The equilibrium shapes of the interphase boundaries are experimentally determined and consequently, the corresponding γ- plots of the interphase boundaries are constructed. These results are significant not only for the materials science community but also for the out of equilibrium pattern formation dynamics branch of nonlinear physics.  ","categories": [],

He then moved to McGill University (Montreal, Canada) to earn his Master’s degree in mechanical engineering, where he worked on laser transmission welding of thermoplastic composites using laser refraction. He then earned his PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Northwestern University (USA) on the topic: Deformation and failure in metallic nanowires under stress-relaxation, cyclic and high strain rate loading conditions. Further, he joined Empa – Swiss federal laboratories for materials science and technology, Switzerland as a Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellow to research on high strain rate testing of microscale materials at extreme temperatures and templated electrodeposition based micromanufacturing. In August 2020, he joinedMax-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung (Germany) as Group Leader of Nanomechanical instrumentation and extreme nanomechanics (XNano) group, which focuses on developing testing platforms and the necessary protocols/methods to conduct nano-to-meso scale mechanical testing under extreme strain rates/ temperatures and localized electrodeposition-based 3D printing of metallic micro/nano architectures.

The field of macroscale dynamic testing was established in the 1940’s specifically for assessing the mechanical behavior of materials under extreme strain rates. But given the push towards miniaturization, micro and nano scale parts have recently become ubiquitous and functional parts in a variety of applications. As such, small scale mechanics has been a topic of intense research over the last two decades. However, to date the micro and nanomechanical experiments have been limited to quasi-static testing speeds and the behavior of small-scale materials under extreme strain rates remains largely unexplored experimentally. In this presentation, I will introduce testing platforms required to conduct micro and nano-scale mechanical metrology at high strain rates. Specifically, I will present a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based nanomechanical testing platform capable of performing high strain rate testing, along with a case study on single crystalline silver nanowires. In the second part of my talk, I will introduce a localized electrodeposition-based additive micromanufacturing (AMM) technique capable of fabricating full-metal 3D micro/nano architectures. Subsequently, case studies on the dynamic mechanical characterization of copper micropillars and microlattices built using AMM, along with complementary microstructural characterization will be presented.

Over the past decade, we integrated the high-speed X-ray imaging capabilities present at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 32 ID-B (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA) with the high-rate loading offered by the Kolsky compression/tension bar and light gas gun. High-speed X-ray images and X-ray diffraction can be obtained simultaneously. The effectiveness of these new experimental capabilities is verified via impact on various material systems, demonstrating in-situ image analysis inside of the material systems during loading rates commonly encountered in high-rate deformation environments, such as high-speed machining, vehicle collision, and blast/impact.

When?  8th June, 2022 (Wednusday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  A key design consideration in flexible electronics, particularly for wearables and sensing applications, is low voltage, low power operation. This requirement not only serves to maximise battery lifetime but crucially ensures operational stability of thin film transistor (TFT) circuits and systems. Ultralow voltage/current operation is especially important in sensor interfaces so as to achieve a high resolution of the sensory signal. This presentation will review the TFT design and materials selection strategies for ultralow power operation. We examine the main issues that lead to a high operating voltage of the TFT, and discuss processing conditions for suppressing the interface trap density. Recent advances in low-voltage thin-film transistors show it is possible for the subthreshold slope to approach the thermionic limit, q/kT. Based on these considerations, an all-inkjet-printed ultra-low-power high-gain amplifier, applied to eye movement tracking by detecting human electrooculogram signals, is presented.

In 2012, Prof. Zhong-Lin Wang and co-workers at Georgia Tech reported the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a new source of energy, which basically works on the principle of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction. The TENG can be assembled within a few minutes using off-the-shelf materials and used for harvesting mechanical energy from the environment which is otherwise wasted. The TENG has a very simple working mechanism, and simple design, and can be used to power many small wearable electronics. A few examples of TENGs devised at the Clemson Nanomaterials Institute will be presented.   A thermoelectric generator (TEG) converts waste heat into usable energy. The TEGs are emerging as viable renewable energy sources, which directly convert the waste heat into electricity. The efficiency of a TEG is related to its figure-of-merit ZT= S2s/k, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, s and k are the electrical and thermal conductivities, respectively. The inherent challenges for increasing ZT will be discussed, and the use of Raman spectroscopy as a facile tool to quantify anharmonicity in thermoelectric materials will be presented.

When?  06th July, 2022 (Wednesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  We in situ observe the ultrafast dynamics of trapped carriers in organic methyl ammonium lead halide perovskite thin films by ultrafast photocurrent spectroscopy with a sub-25 picosecond time resolution. Upon ultrafast laser excitation, trapped carriers follow a phonon-assisted tunneling mechanism and a hopping transport mechanism along ultra-shallow to shallow trap states ranging from 1.72-11.51 millielectronvolts and are demonstrated by time-dependent and independent activation energies. In addition to carrier mobility of ~ 4 cm2/V.s and lifetime of ~ 1 nanosecond, we validate the above transport mechanisms by highlighting trap state dynamics, including trapping rates, de-trapping rates, and trap properties such as trap density, trap levels, and capture-cross sections. This work [1] establishes a foundation for trap dynamics in high defect-tolerant perovskites with ultra-fast temporal and ultra-high energy resolution.   [1] Nature Communications, 12 (2021).

When?  26th July, 2022 (Wednesday), 12:01 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  Zirconium-alloys have been used successfully as materials for light water reactor (LWR) fuel cladding (tubes that contain uranium-dioxide fuel pellets) for many decades because of their excellent neutron transparency, and good strength and hydrothermal corrosion resistance under normal operating conditions. However, in the rare event of loss of active cooling, decay heat can rapidly increase the temperature of the Zr-alloy cladding. This can result in severe oxidation of Zr-alloy in reaction with steam and loss of mechanical integrity of the cladding. This was unfortunately the case in the Fukushima-Daiichi accident in Japan in 2011. A near-term approach to increase coping time in such events is to coat the Zr-alloy cladding with an oxidation-resistant material.  In this presentation I will discuss our research on the development of the cold spray process for the deposition of oxidation-resistant materials on Zr-alloy cladding, with emphasis on Cr coatings. In cold spray, powder of the coating material is propelled at supersonic velocities on to the surface of a substrate to form a coating. The particle temperature is low and coating forms in solid-phase due to high strain-rate deformation of the particles upon impact with the substrate, and an associated adiabatic shear process. Results of this developmental study, including the performance of these coatings in steam environments up to 1300 oC will be presented. In situ examination of radiation damage in a TEM showed lower defect evolution kinetics in the cold spray Cr coatings compared to a reference bulk annealed Cr. It is noted that other materials and/or coating technologies are being investigated for this application and the ultimate implementation of the coated cladding concept will be decided by various stakeholders in industry and governmental agencies.

She is currently a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University (Finland), working in the area of battery recycling. Previously, She completed my PhD from McMaster University (Canada), worked on slag/metal reaction kinetics in oxygen steelmaking process. She had also experienced on application of machine learning in process data while working at TRDDC for 2.5 years. She did my masters (M.Tech.) from IIT Bombay and bachelors (B.E.) from Jadavpur University.   When?  2nd November, 2022 (Wednesday), 03:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  ‘Bloating’ i.e. swelling of droplets is an important phenomenon in oxygen steelmaking process which determines the overall process efficiency by influencing the kinetics of refining. This phenomenon is controlled mainly by decarburization reaction kinetics. In this work, a mathematical model for decarburization of a droplet was developed incorporating all kinetic steps. This model demonstrated remarkably well performance with variation of experimental parameters and specifically with conditions similar to oxygen steelmaking. Another finding from this work was development of a novel kinetic model to incorporate slag electrical conductivity effect into analysis which is generally ignored by process metallurgist for decades despite knowing the nature of the system. Battery Recycling Extraction of cobalt from secondary resources has become crucial as it has been identified as strategically important and a critical raw material due to the high risks of supply chain disruptions. In this work, selective sulfation roasting followed by water leaching was investigated as a potential recycling strategy to extract cobalt and lithium from industrial LCO-rich black mass. Specifically, the effect of graphite on metals extraction was studied. A selective extraction efficiency of 99.5% Li and 60% Co by was obtained by this route.   ","categories": [],

A crucial route to achieve sustainable energy resources that are efficient and economically viable is by fine tuning the performance of materials with appropriate structure and properties. Computational thermodynamics is a powerful tool for designing new materials as well as modifying the structure and properties of existing materials for an intended application. This talk will demonstrate how thermodynamic and kinetic simulations can be employed for the design of materials for sustainable use of existing energy resources, with two case studies. In the first case study, the application of CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) method to optimize the Gibbs energy functions for all the phases in a multicomponent chloride salt system which is important for nuclear fuel reprocessing and thermodynamic calculations to predict the critical properties using the developed database will be discussed. In the second case study, the design of a graded transition interlayer using high-throughput CALPHAD computations for joining dissimilar materials that are commonly employed in advanced ultra-supercritical power plants as well as application of diffusion and Scheil simulations for determining the location-specific solidification cracking susceptibility of graded alloys will be presented.

When?  11th November, 2022 (Friday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  KPA Auditorium   Abstract  Non-wetting surfaces can be useful in several sectors such as marine, biomedical, paint, food industries etc. They are primarily prepared by mimicking natural surfaces such as Lotus leaves, Shark skin, bird feathers, flower petals, Nepenthes Pitcher Plant etc. Typically, the surface chemistries and surface topologies are carefully controlled to tailor the surface wettability. Globally, researchers are focusing on the fabrication of novel non-wetting surfaces to achieve anti-frosting, anti-icing, anti- bacterial surfaces etc. However, most of them have utilized protruding (positive) textures or simply untextured (referred to as flat) surfaces. In this talk, the emphasis will be given to compare the performance of dimples (negative) on the non-wetting properties with that of the positive textures and untextured surfaces. For this, the silicone oil coated textured PDMS surfaces are employed. The static contact angles, dynamic contact angles and slide-off angles of water drops were measured as a function of oil film thickness and thermodynamic models were adapted to explain the observations. Also, the shear drainage of the lubricant and the normal adhesion of the water drops atop these positively textured, negatively textured and flat, oil coated surfaces were quantitatively measured. They reveal that the negative textures outperform the positive textures and flat surfaces. Additionally, these textures have shown high promise in terms of lubricant retention in submerged sea-water flowing conditions as tested up to 7 days. Further, the use of non-wetting surfaces for sanitation applications, marine applications and food industries will be discussed briefly.  ","categories": [],

The overarching challenge is to design alloys that are compatible with the unique additive processing conditions while maintaining material properties sufficient for the challenging environments encountered in energy, space, and nuclear applications. Here we describe a new class of high strength 3D printable superalloys containing approximately equal parts of Co and Ni along with Al, Cr, Ta and W that possess strengths in excess of 1.1 GPa in as-printed and post-processed forms and tensile ductilities of greater than 13 % at room temperature. These alloys are amenable to crack-free 3D printing via electron beam melting (EBM) with preheat as well as selective laser melting (SLM) with limited preheat. The status of computational and experimental design tools that have guided compositional development will be described.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr Daniel B. Miracle  Senior Scientist,  Materials and Manufacturing Directorate  Air Force Research Laboratory  Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45324    When?  06th December, 2022 (Tuesday), 11:30 AM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The influence of temperature on strength in BCC metals and alloys is not simple. Thermally-dependent regions are seen at both low and high temperatures where strength drops quickly with increasing temperature, and an intermediate plateau region is usually seen between them where strength is relatively insensitive to temperature. Together, the complex (three or more principal elements) and concentrated (principal elements of at least 5-10 at. % each) nature of refractory complex, concentrated alloys (RCCAs) may introduce important differences in deformation and strengthening mechanisms compared to BCC elements and dilute BCC alloys. For example, the relative mobility of screw and edge dislocations may be much different in some RCCAs compared to traditional BCC materials, and new models have been needed to accurately predict strength. Early datasets were insufficient to scope the thermal dependence of strength in RCCAs broadly as a class of materials, but increasing availability of data now make such a study feasible. The objective of this work is to answer the question, “is the temperature dependence of strength similar or different for RCCAs as a class of materials compared to BCC elements and conventional, dilute BCC alloys?” To answer this question, we evaluate strength vs. temperature by curating and analyzing a large dataset of results collected from the literature. This dataset includes stress vs temperature for 68 distinct RCCAs, six refractory elements, and six conventional (usually dilute) refractory alloys. Both single-phase and multi-phase RCCAs are included in the dataset and are analyzed separately. We evaluate the transition temperatures between the thermally-dependent and plateau regimes for RCCAs and compare to refractory elements and commercial alloys. The rate at which stress degrades with temperature is also evaluated, especially within the intermediate temperature regime. From this work, general features and trends for the temperature-dependent strength of RCCAs are established and described.   ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Shankha Nag   PostDoctoral Researcher, Material Modeling Division,   Institute for Materials Science, Technical University Darmstadt, Germany.    About the Speaker:  Dr. Shankha Nag earned his Bachelor degree in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from National Institute of Technology Durgapur (India) in 2013 and his Master degree in Materials Engineering from Indian Institute of Science Bangalore in 2015. After graduation, Dr. Nag pursued his doctoral study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) in the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling, supervised by Prof. William Curtin. At EPFL, Dr. Nag developed new methods for accurate atomistic-continuum coupling of random alloys. As part of his dissertation, he also developed a generalized solute-strengthening theory applicable to single-phase homogeneous alloys, where he considered the effect of chemical short-range order and solute-solute interactions across the slip plane. Dr. Nag obtained his doctorate degree from EPFL in November 2020, for successful completion of dissertation entitled “Concurrent multiscale modeling and theory of solute-strengthening for dilute and complex concentrated alloys”. Starting January 2021, Dr. Nag has been working as a postdoctoral researcher at Technical University in Darmstadt (Germany) in the Material Modeling Division, headed by Prof. Karsten Albe. As a part of his postdoctoral research, he has studied the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline high-entropy entropy alloys with low/negative stacking fault energy. He has also worked independently on developing a theory for nucleation of slip mediated planar defects. Dr. Nag’s research aims at the fundamental, multi-scale understanding (atomistic and continuum) of plasticity and phase transitions in metallic alloys, in order to develop predictive theories that can be used to guide materials design in uncharted regions of the material properties space.   When?  16th December, 2022 (Friday), 03:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Materials modeling using atomistic simulations (like molecular dynamics or MonteCarlo) has supplemented experiments in understanding key mechanisms behind macroscopic material behavior. However, the many degrees of freedom associated with these simulations coupled with practical limitations in simulation length and time scales, make it difficult to correlate complex physical phenomena like dislocation nucleation and glide to basic material parameters like elastic constants, stacking fault energy, etc. across different material systems. However, this goal can be realized with predictive theories which model underlying mechanisms in terms of basic material parameters and aid in efficiently combing through the vast space of material properties in search for new materials with enhanced performance. In this presentation, I will discuss theories, free of adjustable parameters, that address the long-standing problems of (1) solute-strengthening by pinning of dislocation segments in metallic alloys during glide [1, 2], and (2) homogeneous and heterogeneous dislocation nucleation. The solute-strengthening theory has been applied to dilute as well as complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) with remarkable success in predicting experimentally obtained yield strengths. In keeping with the recent surging interest in strengthening of alloys with short-range order (SRO), the strengthening theory has been extended to include the effects of SRO [3]. This generalized solutestrengthening theory is state of the art which is applicable to any macroscopically homogeneous and single-phase alloy, and the theory takes inputs that can be measured or computed. On the other hand, the theory for dislocation nucleation finds the minimum stress required to nucleate stable dislocation loop at rates below 0.01s −1 at different temperatures. The theory is applicable to deformation of metals and alloys with nanocrystalline microstructure and shear coupled grain boundary migration mediated by the nucleation and propagation of grain boundary disconnections.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Mr Anubhav Roy  PhD candidate  Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics  The Pennsylvania State University, USA    About the Speaker:  Anubhav Roy is a PhD candidate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at The Pennsylvania State University. He has been pursuing research in theoretical and computational mechanics under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Kube at the Penn State Ultrasonics Lab (PennSUL). Anubhav graduated from the Department of Construction Engineering, Jadavpur University (Kolkata, India) in 2016 where he had gained computational research experience in static nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of 1D structures (beams and trusses). During his undergraduate studies in India, Anubhav had worked 1 as an intern in some of the most prestigious research groups in different institutes, namely, IIT Kharagpur (2014), IIT Bombay (2015) and IISc Bangalore (2015). He received Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics from the University of Alabama (UA) in 2018 where he got the Outstanding Graduate Resarch Assistant award in the same year. At UA, he worked on capturing nano-scale fracture mechanisms by coupling Hardy estimates-based atomistic J-integral with Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations of isothermal (room temperature), uniaxial extention of defective Graphene sheets. Since joining Penn State, Anubhav has been involved in understanding mechanisms within the microstructure of polycrystalline materials. He received the Sabih and G¨uler Hayek graduate fellowship in Engineering Science and Mechanics in 2019 and 2020. Proposing a bottom-up research setup to facilitate an in situ, real time monitoring of structure-processing-properties of additively manufactured metals, Anubhav received the Best Poster Presentation award and a Travel Grant at the International Congress in Ultrasonics, organized at Belgium in 2019. Recently, in 2020 with Dr. Kube in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory, he developed a computational tool “propSym” that can efficiently reduce material property tensors corresponding to general order (rank) across all crystal point groups. As a continuation of the collaboration, he was a part of Dr. Kube’s research to develop the large acoustoelasticity theory for anisotropic materials, introducing a coupling between finite initial deformation and finite amplitude waves highlighting the influence of residual stress. Currently, Anubhav is working on elastodynamic modelling of ultrasonic scattering and attenuation in complex polycrystalline microstructure. He is one of the five recipients of the 2022 ASNT (American Society for Nondestructive Testing) Fellowship Award.   When?  20th December, 2022 (Tuesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Scattering of waves is an interesting phenomenon that spans length scales of planets down to the nanoscale. A scattered wave field carries important information about the medium of propagation, and is useful for a variety of fields in geophysics, seismology, radiology, material science, to name a few. Elastic wave scattering is commonly used as a sensitive tool for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and characterization of metallic microsctructure. Existing analytical models can predict ultrasonic propagation and grain boundary scattering in statistically homogeneous metals exhibiting spatially fluctuating mechanical properties. These models rely on two-point statistics that correspond to the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA) of the mass-operator series present in the governing Dyson equation. The use of the Dyson equation in elastodynamics enables us to apply Feynman diagrams and its rules to the mass operator to readily recover solutions for the effective propagation properties including wave displacements, dissipation, and scattering behavior. FOSA-based prediction agrees well with finite element (FE) results over a wide range of metals for using ultrasonic frequencies within stochastic limit. However, recent studies indicate a discrepancy between the predictions starts to grow for strongly scattering polycrystals. For polycrystals comprising grains of high single-crystal anisotropy, the reported discrepancy is about 63% for Lithium, even for low frequencies in the Rayleigh limit. In our current model, the third-order smoothing approximation (TOSA) based estimates of attenuation and wavespeed are analytically incorporated imposing long wavelength (Rayleigh-limit) assumptions. One of our broader interests includes investigating formal linkages between elastodynamic and elastostatic homogenization theories, such that elastic wave techniques can be used to probe structure-property relationships important for characterizing material behavior.   This presentation will focus on the development of the analytical model. The current TOSA-based model improves the existing longitudinal attenuation estimates for strongly scattering polycrystals comprised of grains with high single crystal aniostropy, like Lithium or Nickel by about 17% or 7% respectively. Furthermore, improvements for incorporating the current model are observed to be pronounced for the cases corresponding to transverse incidence. The improvement motivates further investigation to provide improved estimates especially for microsturctures exhibiting high scattering. The four point statistics based current model is expected to effectively improve the existing elastodynamic estimates of such complex microstructures, such as, in multi-phase (including porous) or textured media, etc.. Beyond applications to NDE of complex materials, the derivation of the current mathematical model may inspire future work in improving estimates for application in other disciplines like electrodynamics and quantum field theories that involve first-order homogenization of the Dyson equation to quantify strong-fluctuation of properties along space.

The novel initiative was formulated by Gouthama, presently a faculty member at IT Kanpur. Traditionally the aim, with which this event was envisaged, was to create a platform for the students of this department to interact by presenting and sharing their research amongst themselves. With time, and with the induction of undergraduates, this event has broadened to include the new members of this department, as well as try to familiarise its students with the research done elsewhere. This year, we take pride in ourselves by maintaining the legacy of this Annual Students’ Symposium for 36 years.   Message from Faculty Coordinators and Conveners  Times of festivity are times to be relished. For a person married to the technical way of life, there can be nothing more joyful than the moment when he can speak about his work to an appreciative audience. This is the moment for which he waits patiently, just like one waits for the arrival of a festive season. One such moment, for which the students of this department wait every year, is the Annual Students’ Symposium. Happening for the last 36 years, the aim of this symposium has been to present a platform for the research students of this department to interact, by presenting their ideas, amongst themselves. It also doubles up its responsibilities and enlightens the students about research taking place elsewhere through talks by dignitaries invited from various academies and industries. The 36th Annual Students’ Symposium will be held on 27th and 28th January, 2023. It gives us immense pleasure to be a part of the organising team of the students’ symposium. We hope the effort that we put in bears fruit through a successful conduction of the symposium, and may this symposium be a pleasurable moment for the students of the department as well.

These attributes make them candidate materials for aerospace and energy generation systems that require harsh operating conditions. The most popularly used high-temperature alloys are the Nickel-base superalloys, and among various Ni-base alloys, Inconel 718 (IN 718) is the most used material. The currently used superalloys are already exploited to very high operating temperatures near their solidus or the precipitate solvus temperatures. Any further increase in Carnot efficiency is only possible through design improvements and enhanced turbine cooling efficiency, which the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique can address. However, the adoption of AM processes for aerospace/mission-critical components is impeded due to microstructural heterogeneities and spontaneous defects observed in AM-produced parts. It is, therefore, necessary to develop processes that head to minimum porosity and design suitable heat treatments, and to evaluate the relevant mechanical properties post-heat treatment. A further approach could be to develop some new alloys that could be additively manufactured and exhibit the desirable properties.   The work carried out in the present thesis is aimed at addressing both these issues. In the first part of the thesis, attempts have been made to develop suitable heat treatments that would lead to desirable microstructures for tailoring relevant optimal mechanical properties that could render the material for the desired applications. Both the most commonly used routes of powder bed additive manufacturing have been used, namely the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and the Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Heat treatment schedules have been designed for both the so-obtained materials, and the microstructure, texture, and mechanical behavior of the as-built and heat-treated AM materials have been investigated. In the case of IN718, the specially designed heat treatment was aimed at optimizing the volume fraction of coherent and incoherent precipitates, and their role in the mechanical response has been explored in greater depth. In the second part, the present work will be substantiated with another class of high-temperature material, Ni-base eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) AlCoCrFeNi2.1 has been produced by additive manufacturing which has shown better mechanical response than the conventional Ni-Al system. A comprehensive understanding of room and high temperature mechanical properties has been developed.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  A fundamental investigation of discrete liquid flow, gas and fines in a random packed bed, along with applications   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Govind S Gupta   When?  06th February, 2022 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The liquid flow through a packed bed is quite common in many chemical engineering applications such as distillation, stripping, catalysis, and in metallurgical processes like blast furnace, heap leaching, etc. Many researchers have modelled the liquid flow in a packed bed using continuum hypothesis for both wetting and non-wetting conditions. However, from the physical observation made by various researchers, in a non-wetting or in a low liquid flow rate (heap leaching) system, it is found that the liquid flows not as a continuous stream but as a mixture of discrete rivulet(s) or droplet(s) or combination of both. The liquid flow in any direction, in a packed bed, depends on the local void shape and size. The deterministic approach to find out the void shape and size locally, is a big challenge which is lacking currently. Moreover, the effect of gas flow on the particles and liquid phase of the packed bed, taking into account the random nature of the bed and the discrete nature of the liquid, is lacking. The liquid flow in the presence of gas flow in a bed of particles is a common phenomenon in various metallurgical and chemical engineering processes. In the dripping zone of the blast furnace, where iron ore is converted to molten iron/slag (liquid), the liquid descends the coke bed in the form of droplets and rivulets. The hot blast of air injected laterally, along with the pulverized coal, from the tuyere region flows counter and cross-current to the liquid flow. A cavity, known as a raceway, is formed at the tuyere region due to the gas injection.   In the current study, the Discrete Liquid Flow (DLF) theory is used to model the liquid flow in a randomly packed bed where the shape and size of the void changes with location, The model considers the discrete nature of the flow taking into account the local non-uniformities of the packing. Random packing has been created using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The void size and shape are determined using a novel graph-based algorithm in the random 2D bed to study the liquid flow. The liquid flow behaviour has been studied in various conditions, like changing the packing size and bed height. This study confirms that the bed topology plays an important role in dictating the liquid flow behavior in a randomly packed bed.   The study is extended to heap leaching process, where the liquid flows as droplets and rivulets due to very low liquid flow rates. The liquid flow behaviour is studied in terms of tortuosity, liquid distribution, breakthrough time, contact angle etc. The study shows that heap leaching processes can be modelled more accurately using DLF theory by avoiding the uncertain experimental parameters (like bed permeability etc). The study shows that bed topology, the local velocity of the liquid, tortuosity, and liquid dispersion affect the distribution of the liquid and the amount of liquid in a heap packing.   Understanding the interaction of gas phase and solid particles of the packing is important before studying the interaction of gas-fines-particle-liquid phases in a packed bed. The study of solid flow has been carried out in presence of gas flow under the counter-current condition in the shaft based processes. Shaft based processes are used in many disciplines such as in metallurgical and chemical engineering. However, their performance suffers due to the lack in understanding of solid and gas flow thus the heat and mass transfer inside the shaft. A slow moving packed bed, inside the reactor, has been considered. Particles are discharged from the bottom and gas is injected laterally. The gas flow has been modelled using continuum-based fluid flow equations. The effect of various parameters (like particle size, gas flow rate, solid discharge rate etc.,) on the residence time of solid particles has been studied in detail. It is found that gas flow is not symmetric inside the reactor due to asymmetric distribution of voids.   Finally, the flow behaviour of the liquid phase in a random packed bed is studied, taking into account the movement of particles due to the lateral gas and fines injection. Gas and fines phase are modelled using continuum-based momentum conservation equations. The study shows that the cavity/raceway size increases due to the liquid injection. The deviation of the liquid path due to the gas and fines drag is also captured. It is found that the deviation of the liquid path is higher for the larger particle sizes.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Arun Devaraj  Chief Material Scientist-Physical Metallurgy,  Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate,  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, Washington    Research Faculty – Joint Appointment  George S. Ansell Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department,  Colorado School of Mines (CSM), Golden, Colorado    When?  06th February, 2023 (Monday), 10:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Materials scientists studying processing–microstructure–property relationships dream of knowing how processing influences the exact location of each atom in a material and how that affects its properties. Such detailed understanding of material microstructure can inform novel material processing approaches, including solid-phase deformation processing, to design breakthrough materials with improved properties and performance. This same ideal applies to researchers interested in understanding how atomic locations in materials are modified from the initial state when exposed to extreme environments, such as under corrosive environments or neutron irradiation in nuclear fission and fusion reactors, or at high temperature and stress in internal combustion engines. Understanding atomic-scale mechanisms of material degradation under such extreme conditions enables researchers to design long-lasting, damage-tolerant, and high-performance materials. However, given the multiple length and time scales involved in both material synthesis and degradation phenomenon, often no single characterization method can provide information on materials from the physical component level down to the atomic scale. Therefore, multiple in situ and ex situ materials characterization approaches must be seamlessly integrated with computational simulations and mechanical testing where possible to enable a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between material processing, microstructure, properties, and material degradation under various extreme environments. In Dr. Devaraj’s research team at PNNL, methods spanning electron microscopy, in situ atom probe tomography (APT), in situ synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are coupled with relevant predictive computational modeling and simulations to obtain a comprehensive understanding of material synthesis and degradation mechanisms.   About Speaker  Dr. Arun Devaraj is a chief scientist at PNNL and research faculty at CSM. He has discovered principles guiding the mechanisms of non-equilibrium behavior and metastable phase transformations in alloys used for structural and nuclear applications, leading to better understanding of the microstructural control critical to establishing novel processing–microstructure–property relationships. He is recognized for contributions to expanding the application of atom probe tomography (APT) for battery materials, catalysts, and biomaterials. Additionally, he is also recognized for directly correlating APT with transmission electron microscopy and for synchrotron X-ray based material characterization methods and simulations to improve the fidelity of APT results by better understanding the reconstruction artifacts in APT. Dr. Devaraj was awarded a DOE Basic Energy Sciences early career research award in 2020. He is the thrust lead of the PNNL Solid Phase Processing Science Initiative and a principal investigator for the Department of Energy (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Office Powertrain Materials Core Program, the Lightweight Materials Core Program, and National Nuclear Security Administration tritium science programs.

When?  08th February, 2023 (Wednesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The phenomenon of flash sintering discovered in Boulder in 2010 is expanding into new fundamental directions. One of them is the view that the flash “transition” exemplified by superdiffusion, a transition to electronic conductivity in oxides, volume expansion and evidence of defect generation, is most likely a phase transition. Fundamental studies of such a hypothesis are enabled by recent work on flash sintering of metals, e. g. copper. Among many applications one significant development is the production of graphene-infused copper with a conductivity that is higher than that of the copper it is made from*. A full analysis suggests that the conductivity of the composite is greater than predicted by the rule of mixtures, raising fresh questions about the presence of space charge at the graphene-copper interface produced by flash.   *Co-Authors: Syed Jalali, Emmanuel Bamidele and U.

Abstract  Rocks and stones have fascinated humanity since time immemorial. Ancient philosophers attributed living qualities to natural stones which could move small particles at a distance. Over centuries, these stones became known as pyroelectrics, ferroelectrics, and piezoelectrics. The ability to detect submarines during the first world war made piezoelectric materials very important. Thanks to the exciting discoveries that happen from time to time, the field has rejuvenated itself several times in the last 140 years, and still ongoing. Advanced piezoelectrics can now be found in devices spanning sectors like space, automobiles, health, Défense, and consumer products. Our group at IISc has been engaged in research on piezoelectric materials for the last fifteen years. It has made notable contributions in terms of the design of new materials exhibiting extraordinary electromechanical properties (such as electric field driven strain &gt; 1 %) and by providing new insights into complex structure property correlation issues in important piezoelectric systems. This scientific journey is marked by eureka moments, which were outcomes of unintentional “mistakes” made by the student, new planned experiments gone “wrong,” etc. The consequent intellectual engagements opened the door to new insights and discoveries.

However, the interfacial area between the fibers and the matrix continues to pose a significant challenge in debonding and delamination, leading to significant failures in such components. Therefore, since the advent of such laminated structures, researchers have worked on several interfacial modifications to better the mechanical properties and enhance such laminated systems’ service life. These methods have primarily consisted of fiber sizing or matrix modifications, while effective fiber surface treatment has utilized the concept of surface energy to form an effective matrix locking mechanism. In recent times, with the advent of self-healing technology, research is being directed towards novel methods of self-healing interfacial modifications, which is a promising arena. In this thesis, we have successfully fabricated 10 layered hierarchical laminates with engineered interfaces for enhanced matrix adhesion and recovery of interfacial weakly bonded or de-bonded sites that may be causes of subsequent delamination and composite failure. Such architectures could widely be used in aerospace technology, especially in aircraft wings and fuselages. Reduction in fuel and maintenance costs of aircraft structures could be attained through increased structural properties and strength recovery attained by incorporating the advanced laminates presented.

Its effects on simultaneously enhancing the strength and ductility in pure metals and single-phase alloys has been studied in great details since the past three decades. The focus of the recent studies has been on the metallurgical alchemy achieved during SPD processing that yields good structure – property correlations. Most of the studies investigating the compositional modulation achieved during SPD have been performed in binary alloys using the high pressure torsion (HPT) processing technique. However, detailed investigations on the effect of large strains on multicomponent alloy systems, containing precipitate phases, have rarely been performed till date. Hence, a systematic study on the microstructure evolution with dissolution of precipitate phases and their reprecipitation during severe plastic deformation processing is highly desirable.   The work carried out in the present thesis focuses on the effect of severe plastic strains applied by HPT technique on the state of precipitates in two ductile cubic alloy systems, namely the niobium alloy (BCC) system and the aluminium alloy (FCC) system. The first part of the thesis focusses on the niobium alloys, pertaining to the composition of the dissolved and reprecipitated carbide phases and the corresponding change in its strength. The results obtained from multiscale characterization techniques have been used to further assess the additivity of strengthening mechanisms in niobium alloys. The plasticity of the HPT deformed niobium alloys has also been investigated and correlated with the microstructures to determine the optimum applied strain. The second part of the thesis aimed at increasing the plasticity and irradiation damage tolerance of Nb – 1Zr alloy, which is popularly used in the nuclear industry, by increasing the sites for absorption of the irradiation induced defects by HPT processing. In the last part of the thesis, the effect of Sc addition in the strengthening of AA-2195 Al alloy deformed by HPT was examined. The microstructural features and metallurgical alchemy yielded by large plastic strains were investigated at the nanoscale to understand the post HPT mechanical response. The role of excess vacancies, dislocations and non-equilibrium grain boundaries were investigated by theoretical calculations and corroborated experimentally by atom probe tomography to understand the contributors to compositional modulations of various alloying additions.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Concept of Intersecting Dissimilar Constrained Diffusion Paths for Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients in Multi Principal Element Alloys: Solving the Unsolved in Multicomponent Diffusion   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Aloke Paul   When?  24th February, 2022 (Friday), 03:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Quantitative diffusion analysis in multicomponent metallic systems has been a formidable task historically despite decades of research. The in-depth studies were limited to interdiffusion, intrinsic diffusion coefficients mostly in binary systems and only interdiffusion coefficients in a few ternary systems until recently. The experimental complications associated with the need to intersect (𝑛−1) serpentine diffusion paths in the 𝑛 dimensional space led to unsolved problems and estimation of composition dependent diffusion coefficients was considered impossible until recently. The lack of diffusivity data in multicomponent systems has hampered the generation of mobility databases essential for microstructural simulation and correlation with various physical and mechanical properties of materials highlighting the performance and durability of the product.   The work first explores the additional advantages of practicing pseudo-binary (PB) and pseudo-ternary (PT) diffusion couple methods established recently in our laboratory. We demonstrate the importance of estimating tracer diffusion coefficients by proposing the augmented Darken-Manning correlations considering the vacancy wind effect. NiCoFeCr Multi Principal Element (MPE) system is considered as a model system for these analyses to compare the data estimated by the new methods proposed in this thesis with available radio tracer measurements. The contribution of vacancy wind effect is found to be very significant on certain cross intrinsic diffusion coefficients. Such analysis highlighting the role of vacancy wind effect was not reported earlier in multicomponent systems. The body diagonal method which was originally proposed for determination of interdiffusion coefficients only is extended in this thesis for determination of the tracer coefficients of all elements from only two diffusion profiles. This reduces the laborious task of producing (𝑛−1) diffusion paths within negligible but equal distances to each other. The requirement to produce (𝑛−1) diffusion paths passing within negligible distances to minimize errors as proposed in the original body diagonal method is often an impractical experimental target.   This work then explores the possibilities of intersecting dissimilar constrained diffusion paths. First, we demonstrate that intersecting a PT diffusion path with a PB diffusion path is easier and more precise compared to intersecting two similar PT diffusion paths. Further, we demonstrate that intersecting two dissimilar PT diffusion paths has the added benefits of estimation of diffusion coefficients of up to four elements. Following, we demonstrate that intersecting a conventional diffusion path in which all the elements produce the diffusion profiles with a rectilinear diffusion path of a PB couple is far easier for estimation of diffusion coefficient of all the elements in multicomponent system for any number of elements (𝑛≥3). This overcomes the limitations of all the methods demonstrated previously for estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the elements by intersecting only two diffusion paths at a desired composition. The equation scheme required for such analysis is established and described in detail.   Finally, a design strategy for intersecting the diffusion paths in Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Al multi-principal element alloy is demonstrated. This is guided by the possibilities of producing PB diffusion profiles in the NiCoFeCr system, This, for the first time, facilitates the estimation of the tracer, intrinsic, and interdiffusion coefficients of all the elements purely experimentally in this quinary system. The tracer diffusion coefficients estimated in this quinary system are compared with the impurity and tracer diffusion coefficients in pure Ni (taken from literature), and at (or near) equiatomic compositions of binary Ni-Co, ternary Ni-Co-Cr, and quaternary Ni-Co-Fe-Cr systems estimated in this study. The relative mobilities of the elements are found to follow the trend 𝐷𝑁𝑖∗&lt;𝐷𝐶𝑜∗&lt;𝐷𝐹𝑒∗&lt;𝐷𝐶𝑟∗&lt;𝐷𝐴𝑙∗ in all the systems.   However, the tracer diffusion coefficients of the elements first decrease and then increase with the increasing order of the systems. The contribution of the vacancy wind effect on certain cross-intrinsic diffusion coefficients is found to be very significant and cannot be ignored. The influence of the vacancy wind effect on interdiffusion coefficients is found to be less significant compared to the intrinsic diffusion coefficients since interdiffusion coefficients are a kind of average of multiple intrinsic diffusion coefficients. We have further shown that describing the relative diffusion rates of the elements with main interdiffusion coefficients instead of the tracer diffusion coefficients can be misleading or confusing. Consideration of different elements as the dependent variable of interdiffusion coefficients may indicate a very different or opposite trend.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Novel L1_2 precipitate hardened Co -base superalloys   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. S. Karthikeyan and Prof. T. A. Abinandanan   When?  01st March, 2023 (Wednesday), 03:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Conventional cobalt base superalloys relied on solid-solution and carbide precipitate based strengthening. They lacked high temperature (more than 800 ˚C) creep strength as compared to Ni-base superalloys which are strengthened by γ′ precipitates having L12 crystal structure coherent with the γ matrix. The blades of land-based gas turbines for electricity generation, need to possess hot corrosion resistance from Sulphur in the gasified coal used as fuel. This motivates the present work, which is to investigate Co–Ti–V alloys to develop Co-base superalloys possessing (γ + γ′) two-phase microstructure similar to Ni-base superalloys.   Co–Ti system has thermodynamically stable γ′ phase but the lattice misfit of γ–γ′ phases is unacceptably high. Vanadium being smaller in atomic size as compared to titanium can be added to minimize the misfit. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of vanadium addition to cobalt-titanium system on the physical and mechanical properties.   The Co–Ti–V alloys were vacuum arc melted and cast into rod form, followed by heat treatments and microstructural characterization. Mechanical testing was carried out to evaluate the strength from room temperature to high temperature. First principles density functional theory calculations, finite element modelling, and discrete dislocation dynamics were performed to analyze the effects of various parameters on physical and mechanical properties.   The addition of V to Co–Ti system decreases the γ′ solvus but increases the solidus and liquidus temperatures. Thus, it improves the homogenisation temperature window. The γ′ precipitate morphology changes from cuboidal to cuboidal with round corners with an increase in V concentration. The composition of γ′ phase suggests Ti as better γ′ phase former than V. The extent of discontinuous precipitation at the grain boundaries in Co–Ti system decreases with V addition. The constrained lattice parameter misfit of γ–γ′ phases decreases with V addition. The γ′ phase is off-stoichiometric with Co antisite defects in 20% of Ti sublattice in Co3(Ti, V).   Co–Ti–V ternary alloys possess improved strength over Co–Ti binary alloy. The strength at room temperature initially decreases with V addition followed by an increase at higher concentration of V. The alloys show yield stress anomaly; increase of strength with increase in temperature with the maximum strength observed at 750 ˚C. The peak high temperature strength at 750 ˚C decreases with V addition to Co–Ti system. Dislocations are predicted to shear the γ′ precipitates due to very narrow γ matrix channels. The γ′ precipitates are predicted to be semi-coherent in the Co–Ti alloy due to high lattice misfit. The anti-phase boundary (APB) energy and complex stacking fault (CSF) energy on {111} plane are predicted to increase with V addition to Co3Ti. Whereas the stacking fault energy in both phases is predicted to decrease with V addition. The yield stress anomaly is possibly due to anisotropy in anti-phase boundary (APB) energy on {111} and {100} planes as well as elastic constants anisotropy.   The creep strength of Co–Ti–V alloys at 700 ˚C is found to be better than γʹ phase strengthened Co–Ti alloy and conventional solid-solution strengthened Co-base superalloys. Grain boundary cracking is observed as the creep damage mechanism. The creep strength decreases for high V addition probably due to deviation of γ′ precipitate morphology from perfect cuboidal and decrease of extent of grain boundary precipitates.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Enhancement in the Corrosion Resistance of Selected High Entropy Alloys by Incorporation of Carbon Nanotubes   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Chandan Srivastava   When?  06st March, 2023 (Monday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  online via Microsoft Teams link   Abstract  High entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted considerable interest due to their remarkable structural and functional properties. HEAs generally contain 5–13 principal elements with the concentrations of each component lying in the range of 5-35 at. % and the mixing entropy greater than 1.5R. Though researchers have reported on HEAs as promising corrosion resistance material, one of the challenges limiting the application of HEA for corrosion inhibition is the phase inhomogeneity stemming primarily from the elemental segregation within the HEA matrix. Such microstructural inhomogeneity promotes undesirable galvanic coupling and accelerated corrosion. This work addresses the issue of phase heterogeneity in selected HEA systems through the incorporation of carbon nanotubes in the HEA matrix. Following systems were studied: FeCuCrNiCo-CNT, FeCuMnNiCo-CNT and FeCrMnCoNi-CNT composites. In all the cases, it was observed that the corrosive properties of HEAs were highly sensitive to the CNT volume fraction and at an “optimum” CNT volume fraction - high corrosion resistance was obtained. This in turn was intimately related to the phase constitution, coating morphology and surface oxide chemistry. Key findings of the work are: (a) In the case of electrodeposited FeCuCrNiCo-CNT composite coatings - the enhancement of the corrosion resistance at optimum CNT volume fraction was due to evolution of single phase BCC structure from two phase mixture of BCC and FCC structure, enhancement in the coating compactness, increase in the Cr content in the coatings and formation of stable protective oxides such as Cr2O3, NiO, Co3O4, FeO, (b) in the case of electrodeposited FeCuMnNi-CNT composite coatings - the enhancement in the corrosion resistance at optimum CNT volume fraction was due to formation of single phase BCC structure from a mixture of BCC and FCC phase structure, enhancement in the coating compactness, enhancement in the absorption of Fe in the coatings and formation of stabler protective oxide phases such as FeO, NiO, Co3O4, MnO, (c) in the case of FeCrMnNiCo-CNT electrodeposited coatings - the enhancement in the corrosion resistance at optimum CNT volume fraction was due to evolution of smooth and compact morphology, incorporation of increased Cr amount and formation of stabler oxide phases such as Cr2O3, NiO, MnO, Co3O4, FeO, (d) in the case of mechanically alloyed and spark plasma sintered FeCuCrNiCo-CNT composite ingots, the enhanced corrosion resistance at the optimum CNT incorporation was primarily attributed to the enhancement in chemical and phase homogeneity.

Recently, Senkov and co-workers [1] reported a microstructure with coherent cuboidal (disordered A2) precipitates in an ordered B2 matrix yielding promising high-temperature strength in the Al-Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr system. However, the alloy lacks ductility at room temperature.   Following along above conceptual path we report here on the current status of our investigations within the Ta-Mo-Ti-Cr-Al system, which exhibits a promising combination of strength and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures [2]. Thermodynamic calculations were employed with an in-house database to predict specific transformation sequences of ordering and diffusion-controlled phase separation within this system. As observed in the Ta-free subsystem MoTiCrAl, Al has a significant effect on the ordering transition from A2 towards B2 [3]. However, in the case of MoTiCrAl, no multi-phase field was found after the homogenization. The situation changes by the addition of Ta, as a multi-phase field is thermodynamically predicted [4]. The microstructure of two compositions (high and low in Al) were investigated experimentally by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, while the phase transitions were determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The microstructure of the alloy with high Al concentration exhibited a B2 matrix with A2 precipitates; in contrast, an A2 matrix with B2 precipitates was found in the Al-lean alloy. The necessary reaction sequences are discussed in detail and provide information about the phase diagram necessary to reproducibly obtain the desired two-phase microstructures. Microstructural peculiarities, such as segregation at planar defects as well as their implications on the mechanical properties will be also discussed.   References:   [1] O. N. Senkov, C.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Study of gas-fine flow in a packed bed with an application to the ironmaking blast furnace   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Govind S Gupta   When?  13th March, 2023 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The iron and steelmaking industry uses coal as the primary reducing agent. The carbon that is the major component of coal is finally released into the environment as carbon dioxide. Therefore, energy consumption in this industry is equivalent to carbon dioxide emission, and various efforts, to improve energy efficiency, have been made. One of the effective ways to reduce the coke consumption and thus the reduction in greenhouse gases is to introduce coal or other carbonaceous materials through the tuyere. However, this can be done only up to some extent as injection of these materials reduces the bed permeability which in turn affects the operation and productivity of the blast furnace (BF).Previous studies have shown that at a higher pulverised coal injection (PCI) rate and depending on the operating conditions of the furnace, some amount of coal remains unburnt and consequently the ashes and coal particles, in the form of powders, may be entrained in the gas stream or be deposited into the lower zones of the BF. Degradation of coke in this region also introduces coke fines which increases more on the introduction of pulverised coal (PC). The powder holdup reduces the permeability of the coke layer and in some cases results in detrimental effects on the gas flow and liquid drainage. This situation becomes more complex in presence of a cohesive zone. These phenomena lead to lower production efficiency and unstable operations. However, the physics of the pulverised coal within the furnace is still not well understood, especially in presence of raceway and tuyere protrusion. Raceway is very important in iron-making BF as its size and shape determines the aerodynamics of BF and thus the heat and mass transfer.  This is the reason that the productivity of a BF has been related to its raceway. The literature reveals that the raceway formed in the stationary packed bed under the decreasing gas velocity condition is more relevant to the blast furnace or moving bed condition. In decreasing gas velocity conditions, the gas velocity is raised above the desired velocity and then is reduced to the desired velocity. No study on two-phase flow is available under the decreasing gas velocity condition. Also, no study is available on two-phase (gas-fine) flow in the presence of raceway and tuyere (nozzle) protrusion inside the packed bed. Therefore, the study of fine flow in a packed bed is a necessary precursor to understand the above mentioned processes/phenomena.   For the validation purpose, two-dimensional experimental studies were performed at room temperature on the various packed bed such as a rectangular bed with and without a cohesive zone and a cylindrical bed without a cohesive zone. Both the packing and fine particles were made of glass material. Steady state of experiment with fines was achieved based on the recently developed accurate mass balance method which dictates that fines into the system must be equal to fines out of the system. All similarity criteria with respect to the BF have been observed reasonably except thermal and chemical. All the experiments carried out in the current study are under the decreasing gas velocity condition which is more relevant to the BF study at room temperature in the laboratory.   Most research neglect vital characteristics of BF, such as lateral inflow, presence of tuyere protrusion, the raceway’s shape and size, and cohesive zone leading to a significant incongruence with the BF being modelled. The present work incorporates these features into a 2D numerical study of a gas–fines–solid system. The mathematical modelling considers the gas and fines as an Eulerian–Eulerian system with the constant voidage model for the solid phase representing the packing particles. In presence of a cohesive zone, the cohesive blocks were assigned zero porosity. Well-established theoretical relations and correlations are used to determine the inter-phase forces and fines accumulation regions. Particular emphasis is placed on the accurate representation of the raceway formed at the tuyere exit, and three approaches are considered, viz., its absence, a correlation-based prediction, and an iso-stress-based model. The effect of various parameters such as gas inlet velocity, packing particle material, packing particle size, fines flux through the tuyere opening, and fines size is simulated and analysed in detail with a marked interest in the raceway shape and size and accumulation profiles of the fines which are important parameters in the overall flow characterization. An insight into the physics based on the interaction forces between the phases, which is difficult to obtain experimentally, is offered to explain the change in the shape and size of the raceway and the accumulation profile observed as the parameters mentioned above are varied. Additionally, structural parameters such as cohesive zone configuration, cohesive block porosity, and tuyere protrusion are also varied, and their effect on the raceway and static holdup profiles are characterised. The sensitivity analysis shows that the raceway shape and size play a vital role in the flow of gas-fines and influence the accumulation of fines. While most of the parameters varied have a noticeable effect, certain factors such as fines feed rate and size exhibit negligible consequences.   The model predicts the static holdup profile through a correlation based on experimental data. Developed model is able to predict the pressure loss reasonably well against experimental and published data for both clean gas and gas–fine flow in a packed bed with a lateral and bottom injection of gas and fine. Similarly, the model is able to predict correctly the raceway shape &amp; size, pressure profiles in both vertical and horizontal directions as well as fines static holdup both in the presence and absence of cohesive blocks. All the results indicate an excellent agreement with the experimental data and lend credibility to the model and solver.  ","categories": [],

A major limitation is their brittle nature under tensile loading.  After an introduction to ceramics and their properties, the brittle fracture mechanics will be discussed. One successful approach to address the brittleness is to make ceramic matrix composites. The role of the nature of the reinforcement and mechanics of fracture of composites will be discussed.

Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS) is a relatively new coating process that enables the deposition of ultrafine droplets (typically from nano- to sub-micron size) that permits the production of coatings with unique microstructures, one or two orders of magnitude finer than those achieved typically in other thermal spray processes. In this presentation the latest results in this field, emphasizing those achieved by axial suspension plasma spraying, are highlighted.   The major application of SPS coatings has been Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) for gas turbine applications. However, SPS TBC for internal combustion engines was not very much investigated. Results from recent work in this field are briefly presented emphasizing the coating microstructure, properties and lifetime under high temperature exposure. In the case of coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, coatings’ porosity is of primordial importance. Results from investigations showed that the SPS process allows a facile control of coatings’ microstructure and hence porosity, so that they can fulfil the functional requirements. Plasma spraying is the only coating deposition method approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for deposition of coatings used for implants and other surgical activities. Results from investigations done on different Hydroxyapatite suspensions deposited by SPS and their properties (adhesion, crystallinity, porosity etc.) are also outlined and discussed in this paper.   The promising results revealed by the coatings developed for applications such as those presented above, may promote SPS as a serious coating method candidate and demand for further studies and investigations, so that new coatings can be implemented in next generation products or adapted for new applications.

Lattice misfit is reduced with addition of Re, confirmed from high-resolution XRD. As a result, the morphological transition from cuboidal to rounded cornered cubes with Re addition is observed. Re solubility limit in the alloy is 3 at. %, and excess Re promoted the formation of TCP phases. Through APT analysis, it was found experimentally that there was no segregation of Re at the g/g¢ interface. With the addition of Re, the 0.2% proof strength is retained up to 870°C with strength values greater than 650 MPa. However, absence of yield strength anomaly (YSA) with Re is observed.   To understand the coarsening kinetics behavior of g¢ precipitates in the alloys, the study is conducted by isothermal treatment at temperatures of 900, 950 and 1000°C for various time periods. By studying the temporal evolution of the following parameters during coarsening, the interpretations are made, and the correlations are established among precipitate size, PSD, lattice misfit, partitioning coefficients, morphological evolution, volume fraction, and micro-hardness. The rate constants (K) values for this class of alloys are comparable and better than many existing superalloys. Additionally, the activation energy for coarsening is estimated to be 260 and 240 kJ/mol, for addition of Re 2 and 3 at. %, respectively.   Pseudo-Binary diffusion couple approach is introduced to estimate the interdiffusion coefficients in multicomponent system, in which only two elements will participate in developing the composition profiles. The same approach is examined for alloy designing and validated for recently developed alloy system, Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Ta-Ti superalloy, in which effect of Cr is considered. The heat treatment conditions are established to transform the gradient of Cr in diffusion couple into corresponding microstructural evolution. The following changes can evaluate through diffusion couple method: morphological transition from cuboidal to spherical, precipitate volume fraction, solubility limit of the Cr for TCP phases, micro-hardness, elastic modulus, oxidation behavior (top oxide grain morphology and layer thickness).

Further, the mechanical properties of the manufactured alloys are sometimes reported to be superior due to various microstructural attributes.   This presentation deals with the work carried out to examine the evolution of microstructure, crystallographic texture and their influence on the mechanical properties on the material system 316L manufactured through selective laser melting (SLM) and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The effect of different scan strategies such as inter-layer and intra-layer on microstructure-texture-mechanical property correlation has been investigated on SLM 316L. The benefits of as built microstructure and texture of SLM and WAAM 316L on mechanical properties has been critically evaluated through tension and fracture toughness studies. Moreover, the role of important heat treatment on thermal stability of structure and mechanical properties are also examined. Apart from this, a spinodal hardened alloy system Cu-15Ni-8Sn manufactured through SLM has also been studied in order to find how benefits of additive manufacturing behaves in this alloy. The role of ageing treatment that brings spinodal hardening in Cu-15Ni-8Sn is also investigated in the present study.  ","categories": [],

Abstract:  Gas turbine engines in the turbine section operate at temperatures exceeding 1300°C, which can cause high-temperature oxidation and reduce the lifespan of turbine blades. To counter this, thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems are employed, which not only provide thermal insulation but should also possess mechanical durability, resist strain, and prevent phase transitions. The TBC system comprises a bond coat, thermally grown oxide, and ceramic topcoat. NiAl, an intermetallic compound, is the main constituent of the bond coat and is crucial in the aerospace industry. The study aims to investigate the mechanical behaviour of NiAl by studying the effect of ternary and quaternary additions of noble elements like Pt and Pd. The study involved preparing alloys with varying Pt and Pd concentrations. Site occupancy studies were carried out using XRD and DFT calculations. The results showed that Pt and Pd strongly prefer to occupy the Ni sublattice in both stoichiometric and Ni-rich NiAl due to their good bonding interaction with Al, as revealed by density of states curves. The effects of addition of Pt and Pd along with the stoichiometry and orientation on the mechanical properties of NiAl-X alloys were also investigated using high throughput nanoindentation techniques. The addition of Pt and Pd was found to decrease the modulus and increase the metallic character of bonding in NiAl, which was demonstrated through density states calculations. Elastic constants were obtained using the indentation modulus with the help of the theoretical model proposed by Vlassak and Nix and compared with those obtained from DFT calculations and the values were in reasonable agreement with each other. It was found that the hardness of the alloys was dependent on their orientation and stoichiometry, and the addition of Pt and Pd resulted in an increase in hardness due to solid solution strengthening. The effect of temperature on the nanoindentation hardness of the alloys was investigated up to 600°C. The study also investigates the effect of Pt and Pd on the brittle to ductile transition temperature (BDTT) of stoichiometric NiAl. To achieve this, binary, ternary (Ni-10Pt-50Al), and quaternary (Ni-5Pt-5Pd-50Al) alloys were tested using uniaxial compression tests performed up to 1000 °C. The results indicated that the addition of Pt and Pt-Pd significantly increased the BDTT of NiAl.  ","categories": [],

Abstract:  Articular cartilage damage is a major challenge in orthopaedics. This medical condition is exacerbated by the inability of articular cartilage to self-repair due to the non-vascularization of the tissue and many other factors. Treatment strategies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, microfracture, osteochondral plug transplantation, pridie perforation, spongilization and debridement have been explored for cartilage repair. However, these strategies require complex surgery and have limited success in fully regenerating functional cartilage. In this aspect, tissue engineering approaches are promising alternatives to the existing approaches for cartilage tissue repair and regeneration.   Snail mucin/mucus is a complex viscoelastic substance containing 90 – 97% water by weight, a mixture of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycan, enzymes, metal ions, copper, and antimicrobial peptides, collagen, glycolic acid, allantoin, and elastin. Some of these bioactive molecules exhibit wound healing, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, whereas GAGs reduce cartilage deterioration and inflammation. On the other hand, agarose is a polymeric material reported for its unique thermal and mechanical properties. It is biocompatible, biodegradable, and suitable for biomedical applications, but it lacks the cell adhesion property required for tissue engineering applications.   The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of snail mucus (SMu) in cartilage repair and to enhance the bioactive properties of agarose hydrogels using SMu to make blend scaffolds for potential applications in cartilage regeneration.   In the first part of this presentation, I will elucidate the potential of SMu as a therapeutic repair agent in cartilage regeneration. The SMu reduced apoptosis in human chondrocyte cells (C28/I2) by 74.5% and sufficiently promoted wound healing, evidenced by the classical scratch assay. In addition, a unique phenolic compound, 6-gingerol, was identified as a small molecule in the SMu for the first time. Subsequently, blends of agarose–snail mucus (AG-SMu) scaffolds were prepared to study the synergistic effects of the blend scaffolds on human chondrocyte cells for potential application in cartilage regeneration. The SMu improved the mechanical property of AG and enhanced the attachment of C28/I2 cells on the porous blend scaffolds.   Finally, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was used as a filler to prepare AG-rGO-SMu composite scaffolds to reduce the scaffolds’ degradation rate to match that of the native cartilage ECM. rGO maintained the structural integrity of the scaffolds with improved mechanical properties and reduced degradation rate. The attachment of C28/I2 cells on the scaffolds was also enhanced.   The results from this study show that SMu and the blend scaffolds (AGSMu and AG-rGO-SMu) can be explored for articular cartilage repair and tissue engineering applications.  ","categories": [],

Zafir Alam   When?  24th April, 2023 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering.   Abstract:  Pt-aluminide (PtAl) bond coat is used as a part of Thermal Barrier Coating (TBC) system on Ni-base superalloy components in advanced gas turbine aeroengines. The thickness of B2-NiAl intermetallic based diffused coating varies in the range of 60-100 µm. The coating provides excellent protection against oxidation to the superalloy components experiencing extreme temperatures of 1000°C during the operation of aeroengine. High temperatures combined with fluctuating mechanical loads can induce fatigue damage in the coating during service. Damage initiated in diffused coating propagates into the superalloy substrate and causes failure of the components. Therefore, evaluation of micro-mechanical properties of the PtAl bond coat is essential from the scientific and engineering application standpoints. The present study evaluates fatigue behavior of freestanding PtAl coating in the temperature range of ambient to 1000°C. Testing of the coating in freestanding form provides scientific understanding of inherent fatigue behavior and the evolution of fatigue damage in the coating without any influence from the substrate.   Detailed microstructural characterization of the fatigue tested coating microsamples using SEM-EBSD, XRM and TEM has been carried out to ascertain the fatigue damage mechanisms in the coating. In the temperature regime of ambient to 800°C, high dislocation activity, formation of dislocation cells and dislocation-precipitate interactions induce strain hardening in the coating. The failure of the coating occurs by the formation of micro-voids due to de-cohesion of precipitate/B2-matrix interface in the heavily precipitated interdiffusion zone (IDZ), subsequent formation of micro-cracks by coalescence of micro-voids, and final failure by propagation of micro-cracks. On the other hand, the coating exhibits extensive voiding, preferentially within its fine-grained outer layer, during fatigue deformation at temperatures of 900°C and beyond. The voids in the outer layer are primarily induced by creep. Cyclic loading leads to the formation of microcracks from these voids, and final failure is caused by the propagation of cracks. The deflection of crack across the coating layers and blunting of the crack tip in the IDZ layer delay the fatigue crack propagation.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Inkjet-printed high performance oxide electronics and its application at sensor interface   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Subho Das Gupta   When?  9th May, 2023 (Tuesday), 2:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  K I Vasu Auditorium [Lecture Theatre], Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Printed electronics is a rapidly maturing field of research, where printed, high throughput fabrication of electronic devices/ components on various rigid/ flexible substrates are aimed at. Over the last two decades, printing of oxide semiconductors has attracted particular attention for their possible applications in a variety of application domain, such as, sensors, thin film transistors (TFTs) and circuits, photodetectors, photovoltaics etc. Although oxide semiconductors can be very attractive choice, however, fully-printed circuits based on oxide semiconductors have rarely been reported in the literature; one of the major challenge here is the absence of a performance-matched high mobility p-type (hole conducting) oxide semiconductor. In this regard, in this PhD dissertation, the performance and capacity of printed all-NMOS unipolar pseudo-CMOS technology based circuits are evaluated.  At first, the deep subthreshold regime of amorphous indium-gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) TFTs has been exploited to fabricate pseudo-CMOS inverters, ring oscillators and static random access memories (SRAMs). In this case, a composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) has been used as the gate insulator and the individual a-IGZO TFTs have resulted in superior device mobility values. The fabricated pseudo-CMOS design 2T-depletion type and 4T-depletion type inverters thus produced have demonstrated an unprecedented voltage gain (Av) of 284 and 325, respectively, at very low operating voltage of 2 V. On the other hand, single inverters and ring oscillators have also been tested for AC performance and found to demonstrate a switching speed up to 30 kHz. Next, even when based on pseudo-CMOS technology, the inverters have shown low static power consumption in the range of few hundreds of nanowatts. While the observed results are significantly superior when compared to the state of the art in printed electronics, it also paves way for many applications in the portable, wearable electronics domain, including interface circuits for sensors, displays etc.  Next, fully-printed and further complex circuit elements have been planned and realized using an identical low voltage operated, electrolyte-gated and a-IGZO based deep sub-threshold operable TFT technology. The TFTs have been further optimized to demonstrate remarkably high ON/OFF current ratio as well as low subthreshold slope near to Boltzmann’s limit (58 mV/decade) at room temperature, which is necessary for the detection of weak biological/electrophysiological signals that are in the µV range. Here, at first, the fabricated pseudo-CMOS inverters with high voltage gain and noise margin are used to fabricate common-source and differential amplifiers that can amplify a small signal (mV range) to a large signal (Volt range) within a suitable frequency range up to 1 kHz. Next, fully-printed circuits consisting of amplifiers along with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have been realized that can interface with sensors and show the analog to digital conversion of the input analog signal. Moreover, the entire circuit is found capable of operating at a low supply voltage of ≤ 2 V, and can be used for fully-printed sensor patches along with readout electronics to detect physical, chemical or biological signals.  Finally, an effort has been made to improve further important/ key parameters of a TFT such as transconductance and subthreshold slope, a new device concept, known as negative capacitance field-effect transistor (nc-FET) has been realized. This device concept follows completely different device architecture from conventional MOSFETs, where the gate insulator becomes a combination of dielectric and a ferroelectric layer placed in a series. With this combination, the negative differential capacitance behaviour of a ferroelectric-gated TFT can be stabilized over a large frequency range. The concepts works similar to a step-up transformer placed inside the device that can result in a rate of change of semiconductor surface potential to be higher than the change in the applied gate potential, i.e. the body factor (m) of the transistor to be less than 1 (m&lt; 1). This can translate to the sub-threshold slope of the device to be substantially less than the Boltzmann’s limit (58 mV/decade) at room temperature. With this device geometry, the TFTs can perform way superior in terms of rapid switching, which would translate to enormous signal gain (η). The total dynamic power consumption should also reduce drastically even when all-NMOS unipolar logic is used. While, the nc-FET device concept is novel and largely interesting, it has never been reported till date for fully solution-processed or printed transistors. In this regard, fully printed nc-FETs could have been demonstrated combining printed a-IGZO semiconductor channel, Al2O3 as the dielectric PVDF-TrFE (70/30) as the ferroelectric layer. The printed devices have shown truly metal-insulator type transition with subthreshold slope of 2.3 mV/dec. while the printed depletion-load type inverters have demonstrated gigantic signal gain, as large as η= 2691, along with a few nanowatts (nW) of dynamic power consumption. Interestingly, the nc-FETs have also exhibited memory behaviour with capacity of holding the state of the device for up to 106 seconds.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Smart textiles with tuneable architectures for multifunctional applications   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Suryasarathi Bose   When?  17th May, 2023 (Wednesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Innovations in electronics and the rapid developments in communication systems have been unprecedented and made life easier. One such advancement is wireless electronics, where gadgets operate in gigahertz frequencies – transmitting and receiving signals in the form of EM waves during their operation. The increased presence of EM waves in the atmosphere has led to electromagnetic (EM) pollution. With the miniaturization of devices, there is an increased volume of complex circuitry in a limited space – causing interference between them during operation, termed “electromagnetic interference” (EMI). EMI concerns are rising as they are considered severe threats to devices and their functioning. Different shielding materials were developed to combat this issue, from metals and ferrites to polymer-based nanocomposites. As the filler loading in a polymer-based nanocomposite is limited by processing and the accompanying stiffness, textiles have emerged as alternative materials with a broad design scope. This thesis entitled, “Smart textiles with tuneable architectures for multifunctional applications,” attempts to develop novel multilayer-like architectures based on coatings to target EMI shielding primarily. Different materials and processes were adopted to maximize EMI shielding effectiveness, UV blocking, and fire protection.   The thesis consists of 7 chapters. Chapter 1 is an introductory note on EMI shielding and textile-based EMI shielding materials. It discusses the terminologies used in EMI shielding, the fundamental shielding mechanisms, and the different phenomena causing attenuation. It presents a comprehensive overview of the evolution of textile-based EMI shields with time and explains the inherent advantages of using textiles as EMI shields over other materials. Chapter 2 is the roadmap of the thesis. It delves into the rationale behind selecting the materials and processes adopted. It explains the advancements in the different chapters, highlighting the critical aspects of each.   In Chapter 3, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based coatings containing iron titanate (FT) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were coated onto cotton fabrics by a dip coating process. The coated fabrics showed an EMI SE of -12 dB at a thickness of 0.7 mm, working on an absorption-driven mechanism amounting to around ca. 92% of the total attenuation. They also demonstrated a 99.9% UV blocking and a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 20%.   In Chapter 4, water-borne coatings were used on pretreated cotton fabrics. Here, water-borne polyurethane (WPU) was used as the matrix for dispersing chemically coupled CNT and FT. The coating was subsequently coated onto polyaniline-coated cotton fabric (PANi-CF) prepared by an in-situ polymerization route. The coated fabrics exhibited an EMI SE of -40 dB at a thickness of 2.4 mm, with the absorption contribution being 83%. They also demonstrated a 99.99% UV blocking and an LOI of 23%.   Further, in Chapter 5, an attempt was made to study the effect of different conducting polymer pretreatments on cotton fabric on EMI shielding. Using a facile in-situ polymerization technique, two different conducting polymers, polyaniline and polypyrrole, were coated onto cotton fabrics to give PANi-CF and PPy-CF, respectively. A carbonaceous layer containing graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) dispersed in WPU was coated on both the pretreated cotton fabrics. PPy-CF showed better EMI SE (-22 dB), UV blocking (99.99%), and LOI (25%) than PANi-CF. The plausible reasons for the enhancement in properties are explained in this chapter.   Chapter 6 adopted a facile mussel-inspired electroless deposition to deposit metallic silver on cotton fabric (giving Ag-CF). The deposition process was optimized by varying the seeding time to enhance the silver loading on the fabric surface. The Ag-CF was coated with the same carbonaceous layer mentioned above (GNP and CNF dispersed in WPU) to give a ‘hybrid textile.’ The hybrid textile showed an EMI SE of -50 dB, the maximum obtained in this thesis, due to ‘absorption-reflection-absorption’ with absorption percentages going as high as 94%. The UV blocking and LOI values also reached 99.999% and 27%, respectively.   Chapter 7 presents a consolidated summary of the results obtained from the different chapters. It also suggests a possible extension of the work that could be done to enhance the multifunctional aspects of the coated fabric.  ","categories": [],

While organic pollutants occur naturally, the rise in anthropogenic and geogenic activities has contributed to an increase in inorganic pollutants in groundwater resources. These toxic by-products should be detected and remedied from the start of the polluting source itself before it reaches out to the ecosystem. Monitoring these inorganic pollutants is imperative to avoid their adverse impacts on ecological and human health. Thus far, variegated detection systems have been reported; however, restricted selectivity, specificity and uncompetitive lower limit of detection impede their extensive deployment. Additionally, sophisticated, and advanced instruments available for the identification of heavy-metal toxins require skilled technicians for appropriate interpretation. Although the traditional colorimetric and/or fluorimetric methods of detecting these analytes are common, there is an underlying hindrance in the detection limit, and ease of usage.   Contextually, solid-state sensors are a better alternative as they operate on low power, provide a better detection limit and have higher reliability. To this extent, my thesis focuses on the design and testing of solid-state sensors to detect analytes such as nitrates, fluorides, and the mutagenic carcinogenic heavy metal hexavalent chromium. Metal-oxide-based solid-state sensors have often exhibited a lack of selectivity and specificity. Hence, the work presented here explores a low-cost alternative viz., bandgap engineered organic conjugated molecular sensors. Biomimetic-based molecular architecturing of a thiourea-based carbon nanocomposite has been developed to selectively detect nitrate ions in water with a detection limit of 10 ppm. The device architecture is that of a chemiresistor. The notorious inorganic contaminant, nitrate, has a high interference from fluoride ion in the detection process. Consequently, it is imperative to judiciously design a selective receptor, which shows a limited response to nitrate ions. A statistical dimensional-reduction method called ‘Principal Component Analysis’ (PCA) has been employed to achieve pattern recognition by minimizing the loss of data for chemiresistive.   Furthermore, solid-state and fluorimetric sensing methods have been established to detect mutagenic hexavalent chromium ions. A carbon-black nanocomposite of metformin-Schiff-base exhibited selective detection of hexavalent chromium, with a limit of detection of 1 ppm. The fluorimetric sensor, however, exhibited a detection limit of 2.9 ppb of Cr(VI). We have then developed a lesser-explored phenolphthalein-structured Schiff base molecular library for the objective study of colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of trivalent iron and hexavalent chromium, respectively. Molecular simulations have been carried out for the ground state geometrical optimizations; bandgap is determined through TDDFT calculations using Gaussian software. Theoretical models utilizing density functional theory provided substantiation for the molecular design method and sensing mechanisms. In addition, the ground state geometrical optimizations and bandgap values have been computed implementing density functional theory. Electrostatic potential maps have been examined effectively to suggest possible sensing mechanisms for the optical sensors demonstrated in this thesis.  ","categories": [],

Chokshi   When?  23rd May, 2023 (Tuesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KI Vasu Auditorium (Lecture Theatre), Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  The substantially higher strengths of nanocrystalline metals has been to attributed to the wellknown Hall-Petch relationship 𝜎 = 𝜎𝑜 + 𝑘𝐻𝑃𝑑-1/2 where 𝜎 is the yield stress, 𝜎𝑜 is the lattice friction stress, 𝑑 is the grain size and 𝑘𝐻𝑃 is the Hall-Petch constant. The Hall-Petch scaling breaks down at grain sizes below ͌ 10nm. The dominant deformation mechanism in the Hall-Petch breakdown or grain boundary weakening regime are not well-understood, with weakening being attributed variously to diffusion creep, grain rotation, and grain boundary sliding. Typically, specimens with the finest grain sizes are annealed to obtain the coarser grain sizes, and the influence of such annealing on strength is not clear. Several studies have attributed the grain boundary weakening regime to enhanced grain boundary segregation or reduced internal stresses caused by annealing.   This study focuses on characterizing the dominant deformation mechanisms in the Hall-Petch breakdown regime. The Ni-W system was chosen as the model alloy, where W is known to segregate at the grain boundary. The Hall-Petch behaviour was studied using nanoindentation hardness measurements, and the hardness observed in Ni-W alloys (3-15 %W) ranged from 6 to 15 GPa for grain sizes from 29 nm down to 3 nm. Solute segregation was studied extensively to understand the role of solute chemistry at the GB, using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) experiments.   Three alloys with 3, 8 and 15 at% W were studied. Different grain sizes were obtained at a constant W content by annealing at various temperatures. A clear Hall-Petch breakdown was observed in the three compositions. Measurements revealed that solute segregation did not increase upon annealing, so that the GB weakening regime cannot be attributed to variations in segregation.   Annealing introduces multiple microstructural changes simultaneously and it is difficult to separate the contribution from each process. Four alloys with W content 19 ± 1 at% and grain sizes ranging from 8 to 3 nm were synthesized by slightly modifying the deposition conditions, without annealing. A clear grain boundary weakening regime was observed, suggesting that the grain boundary weakening regime is not related solely to annealing effects.   The wear behavior was also studied for a 8nm Ni-W alloy deposited on ball-bearing steel used in one of the EOS satellites at ISRO. The wear of ball-bearings limits the life of these satellites. The Ni-W coatings were examined for better wear resistance. The cross-sectional hardness measured for an annealed alloy of 11 nm grain size was ͌ 22 GPa. A fivefold increase in the wear resistance was observed compared to current steel, suggesting the viability of such coatings for improving the life of satellites.  ","categories": [],

USA    When ?  29th May, 2023 (Monday), 3.30 pm (IST)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Porous materials are one of the most widely used materials in engineering applications, ranging from use in soil amendments, catalysis and energy storage. The use of such materials has been accelerated due to the development of nanotechnology, as we are now able to fabricate and tune the pore size of several substances upto the nanoscale. While experimental techniques to fabricate such materials has advanced significantly, given the range of parameters involved, in order to design such materials for specific applications, theory and simulation are required.  In this talk, I present some recent work where we use computer simulations to track and understand the fundamental mechanisms that happen in porous systems, both from an equilibrium and a non-equilibrium point of view. The first system that I will present is a recent application where polymer hydrogels are used in geotechnical applications to improve the freeze-thaw cycle on the strength of soils. Here, both the assembly and the dynamics of the hydrogel/pore fluid will be examined and we will present simulations to study the freezing of water in porous structures.  In the second example, I will look at how porosity controls charge storage and transport in graphite anodes used in Lithium ion batteries. Our simulations will be used to study the effect of the topology of the material in determining its effectiveness. In all these cases, our simulations will attempt to extract critical parameters that control the final properties of the system, so that we can use these simulations as guides to future experimental studies.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  A multiscale study of the thermodynamics and kinetics  of vacancy–grain-boundary interactions   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. S. Karthikeyan   When?  05th June, 2023 (Monday), 03:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Grain boundaries (GBs) influence many physical and mechanical properties of crystalline materials. This is primarily because of their interactions with other kinds of defects, such as point and line defects. Such interactions are known to depend on the structure and properties of individual GBs, i.e. the GB character. Although much research has been done in this regard, an understanding of the effect of GB character on such interactions is still incomplete.   The present study was undertaken to particularly understand the effect of GB character on vacancy–GB interactions in aluminium (Al). To achieve that, the study was done in five parts using a multiscale modelling approach which involved atomistic and continuum methods. First, using molecular statics (MS) simulations, Al bicrystals with symmetric [010]- and [101]-tilt GBs were constructed, and their stability was checked using molecular dynamics simulations. (A total of 32 boundaries were studied.) The GB structures were subsequently validated using the structural unit model (SUM). Second, vacancy formation and migration energies in the GBs were evaluated using MS simulations and the nudged elastic band method, respectively. These results were then used to obtain equilibrium vacancy concentrations and vacancy migration rates in the GBs. Third, using this data and the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method, the anisotropic GB diffusivities were obtained by simulating random walks of a vacancy in the GBs with a focus on the role of the GB. Fourth, a multiple-site segregation equation was used to study the thermodynamics of vacancy segregation in cases where there is a supersaturation of vacancies, such as in-quenched or irradiated specimens. Segregation was studied as a function of GB character, grain size, temperature, and initial vacancy supersaturation. A phase-field method was then used to evaluate the kinetics of vacancy segregation at the GBs. Finally, quantities derived from the atomistic methods were used to evaluate differences in void nucleation and growth rates again in the presence of a vacancy supersaturation, and the role of GB character was explored.   The first part of the study reconfirms the result of earlier studies that a single parameter cannot be used to characterize GBs that crystallographically vary over a five-dimensional space. Furthermore, it was discovered that the structure of individual GBs could be modelled via a SUM. Some boundaries were identified as favoured GBs, and these could be described using a single repeating structural unit (SU). The structure of non-favoured GBs over the entire misorientation range about [101] tilt could be described by a linear combination of the SUs of favoured boundaries. Consistent mathematical descriptions of the equilibrium vacancy concentration and the overall vacancy jump rate in GBs are provided in the second part of the study. Using these descriptions, effective vacancy formation and migration energies were calculated for the GBs. In the third part of the study, KMC calculations were conducted to estimate GB diffusivities. The role of GB character on the activation energy for GB diffusion was also estimated.   The next two aspects of this study are related to a supersaturation of vacancies and effect of GB character on the segregation of excess vacancies and nucleation and growth rates of voids. In accordance with previous studies, it was observed that (compared to a more realistic multiple-site model) a single-site model overestimates the segregated vacancy concentration when the supersaturation was high and/or the grain size was large. Moreover, the difference between the models is pronounced at lower temperatures. Even though segregation of vacancies at GBs was observed to not drastically reduce the vacancy supersaturation in bulk, it substantially increased the probability of void nucleation at the GBs. The GB structure and, in particular, the presence of deep vacancy traps play a significant role in determining the void nucleation rate at GBs. Such deep traps were predominantly observed in low-angle GBs and GBs vicinal to the coherent twin boundary. As such, these were also observed to act as very good vacancy sinks and could better retard the nucleation of voids than bulk. Whereas, although the high-energy boundaries were observed to also act as good vacancy sinks, they were much more prone to void nucleation. On the other hand, the growth rate was found to be less sensitive to the GB character, with voids growing marginally faster along boundaries that have a higher diffusivity. Based on this, it was deduced that void-depleted zones that are experimentally observed in regions adjacent to the GBs are primarily due to the nucleation and growth of voids at GBs which consume the excess vacancies. Moreover, it was surmised that GBs with higher void nucleation rates are expected to have wider void-depleted zones.  ","categories": [],

These attributes make them candidate materials for aerospace and energy generation systems that require harsh operating conditions. The most popularly used high-temperature alloys are the Nickel-base superalloys, and among various Ni-base alloys, Inconel 718 (IN 718) is the most used material. The currently used superalloys are already exploited to very high operating temperatures near their solidus or the precipitate solvus temperatures. Any further increase in Carnot efficiency is only possible through design improvements and enhanced turbine cooling efficiency, which the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique can address. However, the adoption of AM processes for aerospace/mission-critical components is impeded due to microstructural heterogeneities and spontaneous defects observed in AM-produced parts. It is, therefore, necessary to develop processes that head to minimum porosity and design suitable heat treatments, and to evaluate the relevant mechanical properties post-heat treatment. A further approach could be to develop some new alloys that could be additively manufactured and exhibit the desirable properties.   The work carried out in the present thesis is aimed at addressing both these issues. In the first part of the thesis, attempts have been made to develop suitable heat treatments that would lead to desirable microstructures for tailoring relevant optimal mechanical properties that could render the material for the desired applications. Both the most commonly used routes of powder bed additive manufacturing have been used, namely the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and the Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Heat treatment schedules have been designed for both the so-obtained materials, and the microstructure, texture, and mechanical behavior of the as-built and heat-treated AM materials have been investigated. In the case of IN718, the specially designed heat treatment was aimed at optimizing the volume fraction of coherent and incoherent precipitates, and their role in the mechanical response has been explored in greater depth. In the second part, the present work will be substantiated with another class of high-temperature material, Ni-base eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) AlCoCrFeNi2.1 has been produced by additive manufacturing which has shown better mechanical response than the conventional Ni-Al system. A comprehensive understanding of room and high temperature mechanical properties has been developed.  ","categories": [],

In the last decade, however, organic photovoltaics (OPV), leveraging the impressive improvement in device efficiency and stability, have gradually moved from a lab curiosity to a niche market. Their recent success has coincided with the rapid development of effective replacements for the fullerene-based materials that have been prevalent as electron acceptor materials until recently; namely the small molecule nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This relatively new class of materials offer a number of opportunities to develop new areas of research. Between those, organic photodetector (OPD), a technology based on organic photodiodes and thus closely related to OPV, is one of the most exciting. Recent efforts in the field of OPD have been focused on extending broadband detection into the near-infrared (NIR) region. The early absorption cut-off of solution processed organic semiconductors presents a challenge in achieving NIR detection, however, careful tuning of their chemical structures can help extend OPD responsivity into the infrared window. Here, we discuss how to design donor:acceptor blends and control charge carrier recombination in organic photodetectors for NIR light-to- current conversion for high efficiency and stable devices.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Microstructure-Corrosion Property Correlation in Electrodeposited Tin and Copper Based Coating Systems   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Chandan Srivastava   When?  22rd June, 2023 (Thursday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Mode  Online: Microsoft Teams   Abstract:  Conventional metallic coatings are widely used for protection against corrosion. This study investigates the correlation between microstructure and corrosion properties in SnCr and CuCr electrodeposited coatings. The wide immiscibility of SnCr and CuCr systems would facilitate chromium’s segregation in the high energy grain boundary regions, enhancing the corrosion resistance due to the formation of the stable Cr2O3 phase. The first part of the study was focused on developing SnCr and CuCr coatings with varying Cr content. Microstructural analysis using STEM revealed Cr segregation at the grain boundaries of the matrix phases, along with the evolution of solid solution SnCr and CuCr phases. For both SnCr and CuCr coatings, the corrosion rate (determined using Potentiodynamic Polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) varied non-monotonically with Cr concentration, and at an optimum Cr concentration, the highest corrosion resistance was achieved. Higher corrosion resistance at lower Cr concentrations was attributed to Cr-oxide formation and the evolution of low-energy surface texture and grain boundary constitution. The higher corrosion rate at higher Cr additions was primarily due to increased coating strain. In the second part of the work, the SnCr and CuCr coatings with the lowest corrosion rate were co-deposited with graphene oxide (GO) as reinforcement. The corrosion rate of the coatings was sensitive to the volume fraction of the added GO, and at an optimum volume fraction, the lowest corrosion rate was noticed. The corrosion resistance improvement was due to the impermeable and inert nature of the GO sheets. The incorporation of GO promoted SnCr coating growth along the low energy (100) plane, while in the case of CuCr coating, surface texture revealed dominant low energy (111) planes. GO also increased the fraction of low energy low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and coincidence site lattices (CSLs) in both coating systems, thereby enhancing corrosion resistance. A high GO concentration led to high corrosion rates in composite coatings primarily because of the agglomeration of GO and potential galvanic coupling between the anodic metallic matrix and the cathodic GO sheets. The third part of the work involved investigation of the effect of the deposition temperature (15ºC - 45ºC) on the microstructure and corrosion behaviour of electrodeposited SnCr and CuCr coatings. The low electrodeposition temperature (15ºC) yielded coating with the lowest corrosion rate. The surface morphology of the coatings exhibited significant changes because of variations in the deposition temperature. This effect can be attributed to the alterations in deposition kinetics, which, in turn, influenced the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the coatings. The coating grain size decreased with a decrease in the deposition temperature. For the SnCr system, the preferred orientation along the low energy (100) plane, a high fraction of LAGBs, and low average strain within the grains gave rise to better corrosion resistance. Similarly, for the CuCr system, 15°C coating exhibited higher corrosion resistance due to (111) preferred orientation, smaller grain size, increased CSL boundaries, and Ʃ3 coherent twin boundaries.

Alternative approaches based on biophysical antibacterial mechanisms can be the dark horse in the fight against antimicrobial resistance, however, successful translation and commercially viable widespread adoption is dependent on clear understanding of the key bactericidal mechanisms and development of cheap, scalable nanofabrication strategies. To this end, in this work, high aspect ratio nanostructures are fabricated on titanium using dry etching in plasma and it is demonstrated that the nanostructure formation takes place due to micro-masking of the titanium surface with chemical species generated during the etch process. Furthermore, etching recipes are developed for titanium and poly (ethylene terephthalate) based on studies of the effects of several process parameters in dry etching, which are used to fabricate nanostructures with extremely high aspect ratios to study their bactericidal efficacy. It is shown that an increase in aspect ratio affects the nanomechanical properties of the structures and leads to formation of superstructures which can affect their bactericidal efficacy. Moreover, external capillary forces are shown to be capable of enhancing the killing efficiency by exerting a downward force on the bacterial cells. Finally, metal oxide nanotubes generated by electrochemical anodization are demonstrated to be equally effective as nanopillars in eliminating bacteria, but with the additional benefit of scalability, low cost, and the ability to generate such topographies on complex, 3D geometries. The work to be presented is of critical importance in developing an understanding of how bacteria interact with high aspect ratio nanostructures and will find applications in development of next generation implant and touch surfaces.

However, there are instances where external intervention becomes necessary to support the body’s innate healing mechanism. In this thesis, four such unmet clinical challenges were identified: rapid blood clotting, personalized treatment of burns and chronic wounds, and stretchable implants. Herein, we present novel solutions utilizing silk protein in various formats, each serving a distinct purpose in its respective application. Silk protein (silk fibroin) is being leveraged as a promising biomaterial with potent wound-healing activity. The first experimental chapter describes efforts to develop a potent hemostat for hemorrhage control. The primary goal was to develop a first-aid product for use in a pre-hospital setting where professional healthcare providers are not readily available (such as for battlefield injuries, road accidents, etc.). Herein, a bilayered hemostatic foam was designed such that the top bioactive layer served as a tissue interfacial layer to minimize rebleeding without compromising the clotting abilities. The subsequent two chapters describe strategies for personalized treatment of difficult-to-heal wounds: burns and chronic wounds. It is crucial to recognize that every patient and wound type is unique and requires individualized attention and care. To this end, two dressing materials were developed: a hydrogel-based dressing for burns and a multifunctional bioceramic-based drug delivery platform for chronic wounds. These dressing materials were specially designed for point-of-care applications and personalized treatment. Notably, the in vivo studies revealed the superior healing efficacy of the burn dressing compared to the commercially available product. Moreover, the multifunctional bioceramic-based product exhibited promising antioxidant and antibacterial properties, making it a potential candidate for chronic wounds. The last part of the thesis introduces ultra-stretchable 3D printed biocompatible hydrogels. Herein, a ternary blend ink was carefully formulated for extrusion-based 3D printing. The developed hydrogel presented superior mechanical properties, including good stretchability and fatigue performance. These mechanically robust hydrogels have potential applications in stretchable implants, bioelectronics, and flexible wearables. This thesis was accomplished through a collaborative effort with Fibroheal Woundcare Pvt. Ltd., a startup based in Bangalore, India. Some products developed within the scope of this thesis are in the process of being commercialized. With the translation of these advancements into the market, we envision that technologies will be available in the clinic to alleviate clinical challenges for improved patient care.

Lower processing temperature causes difficulty in recrystallization of these alloys especially in two-phase conditions. However, processing in this regime is important for achieving microstructural control for the desired mechanical properties. Furthermore, most of the studies in this field are either in single phase b or about the globularization behavior of mostly a-laths in the (a+b) regions. Hence, there is dearth of information on the microstructural state and role of the b-phase during deformation in these conditions. Therefore, aim of the present investigation is to address the gaps in literature pertaining to recrystallization behavior of a and b phases during hot deformation of near b - and metastable β- titanium alloys in (a+b) phase field.   To achieve the above-mentioned goals in the present work, a metastable b titanium alloy, Ti10V-2Fe-3Al, and a near b titanium alloy, SP-700, both with lamellar starting microstructure, have been subjected to uniaxial compression tests in (a+b) regions as function of temperature and strain rate to optimize the primary processing conditions. Subsequently, the alloys were hot rolled up to 90 pct. in the (a+b) region followed by static annealing as a function of temperature and time to elucidate the microstructural and textural evolution in finally processed condition. In these conditions, the most relevant properties were evaluated for the two alloys, namely, fatigue crack growth (FCG) for Ti-10-2-3 alloy and, superplastic behaviour for the SP-700 alloy.   While kinking and bending is the dominat mechanism in globularization of a phase; grains are formed through CDRX mechanism in the b-phase for both the alloys at lower temperature and at lower strain rate. The best processing conditions were identified that led to DRX of a and b phases through the strain rate sensitivity maps, for both the alloys. Signatures of the deformation texture were observed in the a and b phases of both the alloys in all the annealed conditions. Grain boundary sliding was found to be one of the dominant deformation mechanisms during superplastic testing of the SP-700 alloy.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  A fundamental investigation of discrete liquid, gas and fines flow in a random packed bed along with applications   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Govind S Gupta   When?  04th August, 2023 (Friday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The liquid flow through a packed bed is quite common in many chemical engineering applications such as distillation, stripping, catalysis, and in metallurgical processes like blast furnace, heap leaching, etc. Many researchers have modelled the liquid flow in a packed bed using continuum hypothesis for both wetting and non-wetting conditions. However, from the physical observation made by various researchers, in a non-wetting or in a low liquid flow rate (heap leaching) system, it is found that the liquid flows not as a continuous stream but as a mixture of discrete rivulet(s) or droplet(s) or combination of both. The liquid flow in any direction, in a packed bed, depends on the local void shape and size. The deterministic approach to find out the void shape and size locally, is a big challenge which is lacking currently. Moreover, the effect of gas flow on the particles and liquid phase of the packed bed, taking into account the random nature of the bed and the discrete nature of the liquid, is lacking. The liquid holdup is another parameter which affects the multiphase flow and is calculated assuming the maximum holdup between the particles which may not be the case for unsaturated bed. Therefore, fundamental understanding of the liquid-solid-gas interactions in a random bed is important to improve the processes.   To understand the effect of gas-solid interaction, a shaft-based process is considered which are common in many disciplines such as in metallurgical and chemical engineering. However, their performance suffers due to the lack of understanding in solid and gas flow thus the heat and mass transfer inside the shaft. A slow-moving packed bed, inside the reactor, has been considered. Particles are discharged from the bottom and gas is injected laterally. The gas flow has been modelled using continuum-based fluid flow equations. Spatial variation of the voids in the random bed is calculated using cube divided particle volume (DPVM) approach. It is found that gas flow is not symmetric inside the reactor due to significant variation in void sizes inside the bed. This along with gas variation also affects the residence time of each particle inside the bed.   This work is extended to the liquid flow in random bed using Discrete Liquid Flow (DLF) theory. However, it is found that DPVM approach cannot provide the void shape which is an important parameter for DLF theory. Therefore, a novel graph-based recursive Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm is developed to find the shape and size of voids in the random bed. After this, the Discrete Liquid Flow (DLF) theory is used to model the liquid flow in a randomly packed bed where the shape and size of the void are given as inputs. DLF model considers the discrete nature of the flow taking into account the local non-uniformities of the packing. Random packing has been created using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The liquid flow behaviour has been studied in various conditions, like changing the packing size and bed height. This study confirms that the bed topology plays an important role in dictating the liquid flow behavior in a randomly packed bed. The liquid flow behaviour in multi-size packing is also studied using DLF and DFS approach.   The study is further extended to heap leaching process, where the liquid flows as droplets and rivulets due to very low liquid flow rates. The liquid flow behaviour is studied in terms of tortuosity, liquid distribution, breakthrough time, contact angle etc. The study shows that heap leaching processes can be modelled in more accurate and deterministic way using DLF theory along with DFS algorithm by avoiding the uncertain experimental parameters (like bed permeability etc). The study shows that bed topology, the local velocity of the liquid, tortuosity, and liquid dispersion affect the distribution of the liquid and the amount of liquid in a heap packing.   It is observed that liquid static holdup is an important parameter in describing the multiphase flow properly. Therefore, the liquid static holdup between the contact points of particles is calculated using Young-Laplace equation with a modified approach for its solution which not only gives the maximum static holdup but also the intermediate values of it between the particles. Using the DLF, DFS, the various phenomena, which occur in a multiphase flow packed bed, such as rupturing of rivulets, liquid hysteresis (only dynamic holdup is considered while simulating hysteresis behaviour) have been understood and explained fundamentally.   Finally, the flow behaviour of the liquid phase in a random packed bed is studied, taking into account the movement of particles due to the lateral gas and fines injection. Gas and fines phase are modelled using continuum-based momentum conservation equations. This system resembles with the dripping zone of the blast furnace, where iron ore is converted to molten iron/slag (liquid), the liquid descends over the coke bed in the form of droplets and rivulets. The hot blast of air is injected laterally, along with the pulverized coal, from the tuyere region flows counter and cross-current to the liquid flow. A cavity, known as a raceway, is formed at the tuyere region due to the gas injection. This study shows that the cavity/raceway size increases due to the liquid injection. The deviation of the liquid path due to the gas and fines drag is also captured. It is found that the deviation of the liquid path is higher for the larger particle sizes.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Ashish Sharma,  Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK   When?  08th August, 2023 (Tuesday), 04:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc)   Abstract  Organic semiconductors (OSCs) based on molecular or polymeric π - conjugated systems are being explored for applications in a range of optoelectronic devices, ranging from transistors and light-emitting devices to solar cells. The electronic properties of OSCs derive from their π valence and π* conduction orbitals meaning that the parameter space to engineer semiconductor phenomena can be controlled through molecular design - this enables immense tunability of electronic and functional properties of OSCs. Of special relevance for optoelectronic devices is the spin exchange energy, that governs the energetic difference between the spin-singlet and spin-triplet excitons. Organic Iridium based complexes, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, multi-resonant TADF systems and triplet fusion based blue emitters are some examples where the spin and exchange interactions are optimized through molecular design to achieve efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), as used in smart phone and TV displays.   Recently there is an expanding interest in the process of interconversion between a singlet exciton and a pair (spin-zero) of triplet excitons, which is energetically possible when the exchange energy brings the triplet exciton to about half the singlet exciton energy. The forward process, termed as singlet fission (SF), has the potential to improve the efficiency of photovoltaics beyond the single-junction limit. While a number of SF-capable OSCs have been identified in the last decade, controlling the fate of triplet excitons generated from SF has proved challenging. In this talk, I will cover the fundamental questions related to triplet dynamics and lifetime in SF systems and discuss the strategies that mitigate triplet loss pathways. By experimentally investigating triplet dynamics in a series of structurally modified diphenylhexatrienes, a well-known SF chromophore, we demonstrate that losses can be avoided if the rate of SF is balanced with respect to the rate of the reverse process of triplet fusion. We analyse our results in the context of dipolar and exchange interactions between triplet excitons to highlight the molecular design principles that lead to efficient SF systems and spin control in OSCs in general and enable SF systems to operate close to the detailed balance limit.

While the rheology of olivine is widely studied, little is known about the rheology of olivine grain boundaries and their effect on deformation in the mantle. Forsterite bicrystals, synthesized by direct bonding of highly polished single-crystal plates, were tested in this study to investigate sliding along the single grain boundary at high temperature (1300°C and 1400°C). Prior to deformation, the bicrystals were polished and scratch markers were scribed perpendicular to the grain boundary to track grain-boundary sliding. Bicrystals were deformed in shear loading between two alumina pistons in a uniaxial creep apparatus at 1 atm with applied axial stress ranging from 1 to 30 MPa. The specimen deformation was measured in real time using a high-resolution (~1 mm) linear variable differential transducer. Each test was carried out until attainment of a quasi-steady state deformation rate to determine the creep parameters. Post-deformation microstructural analysis was conducted using a scanning electron microscope and electron backscattered diffraction. Our study established that the creep-rate law for bicrystals is different than single and polycrystalline forsterite. Bicrystals are weaker and shows up to 1 order of magnitude higher deformation rates. SEM microstructures reveal the sliding of scratch markers, which is direct evidence of grain-boundary sliding in forsterite. Here we present the rationale of our research and compare our results on grain-boundary sliding in forsterite with the earlier literature.  ","categories": [],

The focus of the workshop will be on presenting the clinical challenges around Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML), alongside the biological and engineering requirements for successful outcomes.   VML is a condition characterised by the significant loss of muscle mass and function, which can manifest following traumatic injury. Current treatment options include grafting, bracing and prostheses, which all have inherent problems and leave the patient with a debilitating long-term condition. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine hold much promise in this area, but advances in these disciplines are yet to overcome issues around scalability and functionality.   Following the workshop, Dr. Player will set two key challenge and priority areas. In the style of a ‘hackathon’ students will then have up to two hours to formulate proposals as to how these challenges could be overcome, using leading-edge technologies and approaches. Teams will be formed of 4-5 students, with interactions encouraged across different discipline areas.

These intermetallics are brittle at room temperature, but may undergo brittle to ductile transition with loss in strength, thereby limiting the high temperature performance of the alloy. So far, much of the fracture properties of the Laves phase intermetallics remain unknown. In this talk I will discuss the microscale fracture behavior of these Laves phases as a function of composition and temperature using in-situ nano- and micromechanical testing. Firstly, to understand the role of crystal orientation on fracture the potential crack planes were identified and corresponding fracture toughness of these planes was determined using nanoindentation and microcantilever fracture testing. For different crack plane orientations and Laves phase compositions, brittle fracture with low anisotropy in fracture toughness was observed. Subsequently, the effect of temperature on microscale fracture was investigated. Through high temperature nanoindentation the regime for change in deformation was identified, followed by indentation-based micro-pillar splitting at elevated temperatures to determine transition from brittle to ductile failure.

A thermosetting polymer contains a permanent crosslinked network and is one that undergoes degradation without going through fluid state on heating at high temperatures. This in turn dramatically reduces its durability and longevity which persuades the requirement of disposing it in landfills or incineration leading to environmental pollution and difficulty in waste management. Unfortunately, this disposal strategy attributes to the rising dangers and concerns for the environment. Epoxy resins are thermosetting polymeric liquids that are viscous and contain epoxides in their chemical structure. Its properties such as light weight, good adhesion, high moisture and chemical resistance, strong durability at high and low temperatures, low shrinkage and great mechanical properties makes it a desirable matrix use in various applications. There is an increasing need for sustainable polymeric materials that not only exceed strict performance requirements but also have the capacity to be recycled and reprocessed in several different industries, including aerospace, automotive, transportation, and medical.   In recent times, the emergence of vitrimers with self-healing technology has sparked significant interest in exploring innovative approaches for self-healing on the interface as well as bulk phenomena. This area shows great promise and potential for advancements in various fields. Vitrimers have become a potential class of polymers because of these demands. Unlike other materials, vitrimers have dynamic covalent crosslinks that enable temperature-dependent exchange kinetics. This property enables vitrimers to behave like thermoplastics that can be reprocessed at high temperatures along with retaining and accomplishing the desired resistance to chemical and mechanical stress comparable to thermosets at the application temperatures. These unconventional polymer networks rely on dynamic bonds that can react reversibly, namely covalent adaptable networks (CANs). The CANs could release stress from deformation, allowing the crosslinked polymers to be reprocessed, reshaped, and recycled. The heavy amounts of stress, force, high temperature, and pressure in various applications that the material is subjected to results in cracks and fractures and consequently the life of the material is shortened.   In this thesis, we have successfully synthesized single dual and triple dynamics CANs that are epoxy-based vitrimer by using the various types of chemistry like transesterification, disulphide metathesis, silyl ether exchange, imine, and acetal exchange. We developed fast curing Epoxies (which cure within 2 hours) using Vitrimer chemistries. By incorporating this covalent adaptable network, various epoxies were designed which can cure within 2-10 hours. The resulting epoxy vitrimers exhibited high tensile strength, exceptionally high Tg, fast stress relaxation and high activation energy.  Such epoxy-based vitrimer materials could widely be used in various applications in automobile, aerospace technology. Reduction in maintenance costs of structures could be attained through incorporating the vitrimer chemistry. The resulting epoxy vitrimers also exhibited self-healing, reusability and re-processability properties triggered by the exchangeable bonds attained by incorporating the vitrimer chemistry presented.

Its effects on simultaneously enhancing the strength and ductility in pure metals and single-phase alloys has been studied in great details since the past three decades. The focus of the recent studies has been on the metallurgical alchemy achieved during SPD processing that yields good structure – property correlations. Most of the studies investigating the compositional modulation achieved during SPD have been performed in binary alloys using the high-pressure torsion (HPT) processing technique. However, detailed investigations on the effect of large strains on multicomponent alloy systems, containing precipitate phases, have rarely been performed till date. Hence, a systematic study on the microstructure evolution with dissolution of precipitate phases and their reprecipitation during severe plastic deformation processing is highly desirable.               The work carried out in the present thesis focuses on the effect of severe plastic strains applied by HPT technique on the state of precipitates in two ductile cubic alloy systems, namely the niobium alloy (BCC) system and the aluminium alloy (FCC) system. The first part of the thesis focusses on the niobium alloys, pertaining to the composition of the dissolved and reprecipitated carbide phases and the corresponding change in its strength. The results obtained from multiscale characterization techniques have been used to further assess the additivity of strengthening mechanisms in niobium alloys. The plasticity of the HPT deformed niobium alloys has also been investigated and correlated with the microstructures to determine the optimum applied strain. The second part of the thesis aimed at increasing the plasticity and irradiation damage tolerance of Nb – 1Zr alloy, which is popularly used in the nuclear industry, by increasing the sites for absorption of the irradiation induced defects by HPT processing. In the last part of the thesis, the effect of Sc addition in the strengthening of AA-2195 Al alloy deformed by HPT was examined. The microstructural features and metallurgical alchemy yielded by large plastic strains were investigated at the nanoscale to understand the post HPT mechanical response. The role of excess vacancies, dislocations and non-equilibrium grain boundaries were investigated by theoretical calculations and corroborated experimentally by atom probe tomography to understand the contributors to compositional modulations of various alloying additions.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Solving The Unsolved In Multicomponent Diffusion: The Concept Of Constrained Diffusion Couple Methods   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Aloke Paul   When?  1st September, 2023 (Friday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Diffusion studies in multicomponent systems present formidable  challenges even after half a century of work in the field since the s= ystematization of the phenomenological formalism of diffusion. The chemical interdiffusion method is the most popular approach for  experimental studies in diffusion. However, the requirement to fulfil  the stringent mathematical conditions of Onsager’s formalism in  experimental studies of multicomponent systems has historically limited  most studies to binary and ternary systems. Historically, all types of  diffusion coefficients could be estimated in binary systems, while only  interdiffusion coefficients were estimated in ternary systems. The  experimental complications associated with the need to intersect (n-1)  serpentine diffusion paths in the n dimensional space led to unsolved  problems and estimation of composition dependent diffusion coefficients  were considered impossible for higher order systems until recently. The  lack of diffusivity data in multicomponent systems has hampered the  generating mobility databases essential for microstructural simulation  and correlation with various physical and mechanical properties of  materials highlighting the performance and durability of the product.   Recently, a number of new methods that elegantly overcome the  experimental difficulties in fulfilling the mathematical preconditions  in multicomponent systems have come to fore, thus enabling the  estimation of the diffusivities. NiCoFeCr Multi Principal Element (MPE)  system is considered as a model system for these analyses to compare the  data estimated by the new methods proposed in this thesis with the  available radiotracer data for the equiatomic alloy.   This work first explores the intricacies of the pseudo-binary (PB)  diffusion couple approach in the NiCoCr system and later extends it to  the NiCoFeCr system. The evolution of the mathematical formalism for  pseudo-binary diffusion couples from conventional multicomponent  systems, and its extension to estimate the interdiffusion coefficients  and then the modifications to Darken-Manning relations necessary for the  determination of the intrinsic and tracer coefficients from PB couples  for the equiatomic NiCoFeCr alloy is explored in this section.   This work then extends the recently proposed pseudo-ternary (PT) method  by modifying the Darken-Manning formalism for the case of three  components developing a diffusion profile, keeping rest of the  components constant, to enable the calculation of tracer coefficients  and the intrinsic coefficients at the intersection of two PT diffusion  paths. Application of the PT approach to the NiCoFeCr system via two  different sets of PT diffusion couples (Cr constant and Fe constant)  enables the estimation of the tracer coefficients of all four components  which can be subsequently used to estimate the intrinsic and  interdiffusion coefficients as well.   The body diagonal method originally proposed for determination of  interdiffusion coefficients only is extended in this thesis for benefits  of determination of the tracer coefficients of all elements from only  two diffusion profiles. This reduces the laborious task of producing  (n-1) diffusion paths that need to pass within negligible but equal  distances to each other to reduce the complex unknown errors that arise  due to the lack of direct intersection between the diffusion paths.  Using the modified body diagonal approach proposed in this work, the  tracer coefficients of all components can be estimated from the  intersection of just two diffusion paths, which can be used to estimate  the conventional intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients by the  application of Darken-Manning (with vacancy wind effect) or  Kirklady-Lane relations (without vacancy wind effect). The obtained  tracer diffusion coefficients show a good match with the data estimated  from radio tracer methods extended to the temperature of interest.   This work then explores the possibilities of intersecting diffusion  paths of a dissimilar nature to take advantage of the constrained nature  of the PB and PT diffusion paths to target intersection at a specific  composition and also determine diffusivities of all components from a  single set of experiments only. First, we demonstrated that intersecting  a PT diffusion path with a PB diffusion path is easier compared to  intersecting two similar PT diffusion paths. Further, we have  demonstrated that intersecting two, but dissimilar PT diffusion paths  brings the advantage of estimation of diffusion coefficients of four  elements. Following, we demonstrated that intersecting a conventional  diffusion path in which all the elements produce the diffusion profiles  by a rectilinear diffusion path of a PB couple is far easier for  estimation of diffusion coefficient of all the elements in  multicomponent systems with any number of elements (n≥3). This overcomes  the limitations of all the methods demonstrated until now for estimation  of diffusion coefficients of all the elements by intersecting only two  diffusion paths at a desired composition. The equation scheme required  for such analysis is established and described in detail. The influence  of vacancy wind effect on the intrinsic coefficients and the interdiffus= ion coefficients is studied in detail to demonstrate the importance of estimating the diffusivities considering the vacancy wind  effect. Vacancy wind factor strongly influences certain cross  coefficients, to the extent that it may even change the sign of certain  cross coefficients as well. Compared to the intrinsic coefficients,  however interdiffusion coefficients are relatively less affected by the  vacancy wind factor but it is still crucial to consider the vacancy wind  factor in the calculations.   Having established the efficacy of these approaches in the NiCoFeCr  system, the ideas are extended to the five component NiCoFeCrAl to  estimate the diffusivities of all the components. Following, a design  strategy for intersecting the diffusion paths in Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Al  multi-principal element alloy is demonstrated. This is guided by the  possibilities of producing PB diffusion profiles in the NiCoFeCr system,  This, for the first time, facilitates the estimation of the tracer,  intrinsic, and interdiffusion coefficients of all the elements purely  experimentally in this quinary system. The tracer diffusion coefficients  estimated in this quinary system are compared with the impurity and  tracer diffusion coefficients in pure Ni (taken from literature), and at  (or near) equiatomic compositions of binary Ni-Co, ternary Ni-Co-Cr, and  quaternary Ni-Co-Fe-Cr systems estimated in this study. The relative  mobilities of the elements are found to follow the trend D_Ni^   &lt;(&gt;= «)&gt;D_Co^   &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;D_Fe^   &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;D_Cr^   &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;D_Al^   in all the systems. However, the tracer diffusion coefficients of the elements  first decrease and then increase with the increasing order of the  systems. The contribution of the vacancy wind effect on certain  cross-intrinsic diffusion coefficients is found to be very significant  and cannot be ignored. The influence of the vacancy wind effect on  interdiffusion coefficients is found to be less significant compared to  the intrinsic diffusion coefficients since interdiffusion coefficients  are kind of average of multiple intrinsic diffusion coefficients. We h= ave further shown that describing the relative mobilities of the elements with main interdiffusion coefficients instead of the  tracer diffusion coefficients can be misleading or confusing.  Consideration of different elements as the dependent component of  interdiffusion coefficients may indicate a very different or even a  completely opposite trend for the diffusivities.   The methods described in this work are simple and enable the estimation  of tracer diffusion coefficients as well as intrinsic diffusion and  interdiffusion coefficients from interdiffusion based experiments. The  advantage of the need for only two diffusion paths for the estimation of  all types of diffusion coefficients is demonstrated, which are needed  for understanding the nature of diffusion paths (from the interdiffusion  coefficients) or the data (tracer and intrinsic diffusion coefficients)  needed for microstructural simulation and correlation with the  high-temperature mechanical properties. This can now be extended to  other systems, for example, Ni, Co, and Fe-rich multicomponent materials  used extensively in various applications or the Al, Si, Pt, etc.  containing materials in which the radiotracer method cannot be utilized.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  High-Throughput Bending for Investigating Creep Behavior Affected by Structural and Microstructural Inhomogeneities   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Praveen Kumar and Prof. Vikram Jayaram   When?  18th September, 2023 (Monday), 03:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  K I Vasu Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  The bending of cantilevers is an alternate technique for the extraction of power-law creep parameters of materials. It has been shown earlier that in simple homogeneous systems, digital image correlation (DIC) can provide a high-throughput evaluation of creep parameters by obtaining multiple stress-strain rate pairs from a single test in a geometry that can accommodate small samples and simple fixturing. The present thesis attempts to extend the usefulness of this technique to more complex systems which display large or small-scale microstructural gradients.   In the first example, bending is used in conjunction with DIC and finite element analysis (FEA) to show, that creep deformation in T22 (2.25Cr-1Mo) steels is localized to ~30% of the beam volume near the constrained end for power law exponents ~ 5-7. Therefore, the fabrication of composite cantilevers is proposed as an alternative for minimising the volume of material for testing. The ‘structural inhomogeneity’ is defined in the form of a composite consisting of an active creeping portion (T22) and an additively extended passive non-creeping portion (IN-718). The optimisation process involved varying T22 steel length, ‘a’ while keeping the total sample length, ‘L’, constant. High-temperature DIC (600°C) was used to measure creep for varying a/L ratios. An excellent match between monolithic and composite beam creep behaviour was observed. Moreover, the 5% a/L composite beam showed a good match with monolithic behaviour after stress estimation from FEA while taking care of chamfer effects.   The second example comes from a study of the influence of microstructurally textured regions (MTRs) in a commercial rolled Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Such macroscopic inhomogeneities lead to long-range strain localisation owing to the non-uniform deformation. The well-known tension-compression asymmetry in titanium during the c+a dislocation glide is captured using the small-scale bending of samples at room temperature. The presence of extended  MTRs along the rolling direction (RD) lead to a shift in the neutral axis towards the other half of the cantilever. Thus, the anisotropy and asymmetry in creep are readily brought out uniquely in a single experiment via the geometry of bending creep. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) was established as a unique quantative technique to identify and characterise MTRs in large areas. Microstructure correlations have been made using integrated PLM and DIC as a high throughput method to correlate the presence of such MTRs with the creep behaviour at room temperature.   Overall, these experiments serve as a foundation for the study of creep in weldments, joints and other complex material combinations in future.

Abstract  Articular cartilage damage is a major challenge in orthopaedics. This  medical condition is exacerbated by the inability of articular cartilage  to self-repair due to the non-vascularization of the tissue and many  other factors. Treatment strategies such as autologous chondrocyte  implantation, microfracture, osteochondral plug transplantation, pridie  perforation, spongilization and debridement have been explored for  cartilage repair. However, these strategies require complex surgery and  have limited success in fully regenerating functional cartilage. In this  aspect, tissue engineering approaches are promising alternatives to the  existing approaches for cartilage tissue repair and regeneration.   Snail mucin/mucus is a complex viscoelastic substance containing 90 –  97% water by weight, a mixture of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycan, enzymes, metal ions, copper, and antimicrobial peptides, collagen, glycolic acid, allantoin, and elastin. Some of  these bioactive molecules exhibit wound healing, anti-inflammatory, and  antibacterial properties, whereas GAGs reduce cartilage deterioration  and inflammation. On the other hand, agarose is a polymeric material  reported for its unique thermal and mechanical properties. It is  biocompatible, biodegradable, and suitable for biomedical applications,  but it lacks the cell adhesion property required for tissue engineering  applications.   The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential  therapeutic effects of snail mucus (SMu) in cartilage repair and to e= nhance the bioactive properties of agarose hydrogels using SMu to make blend scaffolds for potential applications in cartilage  regeneration.   In the first part of this presentation, I will elucidate the potential  of SMu as a therapeutic repair agent in cartilage regeneration. The SMu  reduced apoptosis in human chondrocyte cells (C28/I2) by 74.5% and  sufficiently promoted wound healing, evidenced by the classical scratch  assay. In addition, a unique phenolic compound, 6-gingerol, was  identified as a small molecule in the SMu for the first time.  Subsequently, blends of agarose–snail mucus (AG-SMu) scaffolds were  prepared to study the synergistic effects of the blend scaffolds on  human chondrocyte cells for potential application in cartilage  regeneration. The SMu improved the mechanical property of AG and  enhanced the attachment of C28/I2 cells on the porous blend scaffolds.   Finally, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was used as a filler to prepare  AG-rGO-SMu composite scaffolds to reduce the scaffolds’ degradation rate  to match that of the native cartilage ECM. rGO maintained the structural  integrity of the scaffolds with improved mechanical properties and  reduced degradation rate. The attachment of C28/I2 cells on the  scaffolds was also enhanced.   The results from this study show that SMu and the blend scaffolds (AGSMu  and AG-rGO-SMu) can be explored for articular cartilage repair and  tissue engineering applications.  ","categories": [],

As they are non-degradable, their removal requires revision surgery, which is expensive and patient unfriendly. As an alternative, Mg-based biomaterials are being actively explored as bioresorbable implants. The low Young’s modulus of Mg also helps to minimize stress shielding. However, the high corrosion rate and low strength limit its clinical application. In practice, severe plastic deformation (SPD) can significantly improve mechanical properties; however, the effect of SPD processing on Mg-based biomaterials is not well understood. This work aimed to study the effect of processing Mg-6Zn-.2Ce alloy by high-pressure torsion (HPT). Samples were processed using 6 GPa pressure for 1, 2, or 5 turns. Tensile tests using sub-standard samples, machined from HPT-processed disks, were performed using a micro-mechanical tester, and the 2D strain field was accurately measured using digital image correlation. An in vitro study was performed to assess its cytocompatibility. Critical assessment of corrosion was performed using both electrochemical analysis and immersion method. Two-turn HPT samples exhibited a five-fold increment in yield strength compared to the annealed, coarse-grained sample, with about a 50 % reduction in ductility. This increment in strength is consistent with the HPT-induced grain refinement from ≈300 µm to ≈50 nm after two turns of HPT. The two-hour open circuit potential (OCP) in stimulated bodily fluid (SBF) showed potential shifts toward the noble direction. Two-turn HPT samples also exhibited the lowest corrosion rate in the two-hour immersion test. An immersion test in SBF for three days revealed a high corrosion rate; however, the corrosion rates of all HPT-processed samples were similar and slightly lower than that of the annealed sample. Finally, cytotoxicity was evaluated by the indirect cell culture method, which showed good biocompatibility, with an insignificant change in cytotoxicity after HPT processing. Notably, the number of cells grew significantly from 1 to 3 days, suggesting good proliferation. In summary, HPT processing to lesser turns demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the suitability of Mg-6Zn-0.2Ce alloy for bioresorbable implants. It offers significantly increased strength, favorable corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility, thus addressing some of the key limitations of conventional fixation devices.  ","categories": [],

Abstract  Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has gained considerable interest  because of its ability of near net shape building of the components,  one-go production, ability to make intricate designs and minimized  wastage. Further, the mechanical properties of the manufactured alloys  are sometimes reported to be superior due to various microstructural  attributes.

Abstract  The studies are conducted to understand the effect of Re addition on  microstructural evolution and coarsening kinetics of new Co-Ni-= Al-Ti-Nb-Cr based superalloys. Lattice misfit is reduced with addition of Re, confirmed from high-resolution XRD. As a result, the  morphological transition from cuboidal to rounded cornered cubes with Re  addition is observed. Re solubility limit in the alloy is 3 at. %, and  excess Re promoted the formation of TCP phases. Through APT analysis, it  was found experimentally that there was no segregation of Re at the  / interface. With the addition of Re, the 0.2% proof strength is  retained up to 870°C with strength values greater than 650 MPa. However,  absence of yield strength anomaly (YSA) with Re is observed.   To understand the coarsening kinetics behavior of  precipitates in  the alloys, the study is conducted by isothermal treatment at t= emperatures of 900, 950 and 1000C for various time periods. By studying the temporal evolution of the following parameters during  coarsening, the interpretations are made, and the correlations are  established among precipitate size, PSD, lattice misfit, partitioning  coefficients, morphological evolution, volume fraction, and  micro-hardness. The rate constants (K) values for this class of alloys  are comparable and better than many existing superalloys. Additionally,  the activation energy for coarsening is estimated to be 260 and 240  kJ/mol, for addition of Re 2 and 3 at. %, respectively.   Pseudo-Binary diffusion couple approach is introduced to estimate the  interdiffusion coefficients in multicomponent system, in which only two  elements will participate in developing the composition profiles. The  same approach is examined for alloy designing and validated for recently  developed alloy system, Co-Ni-Al-Mo-Ta-Ti superalloy, in which effect of  Cr is considered. The heat treatment conditions are established to  transform the gradient of Cr in diffusion couple into corresponding  microstructural evolution. The following changes can evaluate through  diffusion couple method: morphological transition from cuboidal to  spherical, precipitate volume fraction, solubility limit of the Cr for  TCP phases, micro-hardness, elastic modulus, oxidation behavior (top  oxide grain morphology and layer thickness).

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Effect of Electric Current Pulses on Prec-cracked Metallic Foils: From Crack Propagation to Healing of Cracks   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Praveen Kumar   When?  26th September, 2023 (Tuesday), 03:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  K I Vasu Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Both scientifically and technologically, it is important to study the effects of electric current pulses on the structural integrity of metallic components. As an electric current reverses its direction across a crack, massive current crowding occurs at the crack tip, generating a non-uniform temperature field sourcing away from the crack tip. Additionally, considerable electromagnetic forces are generated on the crack faces that open it in Mode I. Recent studies have shown that due to the synergistic effects of the above two stimuli, a pre-existing flaw may either grow or heal upon applying an electric pulse of high density. While one is a bane for structural integrity, the other is a boon to in-service components. Building upon the prior research on flaw/ crack propagation due to self-induced electromagnetic forces, the synergistic effects of external fields (i.e., external magnetic field and mechanical loading) on the fracture of current-carrying pre-notched Al foils are investigated using an experimental-numerical coupled approach. The coupling of the external fields with the electromagnetic loading is analyzed using the finite element method. Linear elastic fracture mechanics is applied to ascertain that the crack initiated and propagated from a notch existing in the Al foil at a stress intensity factor marginally greater than the plane stress fracture toughness of Al foils. Interestingly, a transition of in-plane fracture to a mixed mode fracture (essentially occurring due to local buckling) of a current-carrying Al foil in the presence of a high external magnetic field is observed and discussed with the help of finite element analysis. Finally, a fully automated tool is developed for the toolless machining of thin metallic conductors using a combination of electromagnetic and mechanical loading. Further, the study explores the attributes responsible for transitioning from flaw propagation to flaw healing upon passing an electric current pulse. A comprehensive understanding of the electro-pulsing parameters on the crack healing process is obtained using finite element analysis. The conjugate experiments performed on SS 316 reveal a complete solid-state bonding of a through-thickness fatigue crack due to high-density electro-pulsing. One of the key strengths of this study lies in the in-depth understanding of the bonding mechanisms. In addition to elucidating the role of electromagnetic and thermal effects of electric current on the healing process, the study also thoroughly discusses the influence of athermal effects, such as electroplasticity and electromigration, on the crack healing process. Overall, the developed understanding in this work opens up new avenues for exploring material healing techniques.  ","categories": [],

The processing and suitable parameter optimisation of FeCo alloy by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is undertaken. Due to the high cooling rate during LPBF processing, the formation of the brittle B2 phase is suppressed producing FeCo alloys with an optimum combination of yield strength and elongation. The optimised processing parameters are used for defect-free fabrication of the rotor shaft of an electric motor. A novel material type fabricated using additive manufacturing is microarchitectured material. Here the development of Fe-3Si alloy micro-lattice structures using LPBF is taken. These micro-lattices find use in rotor shafts to reduce eddy current losses. Another aspect is to study the effect of microarchitecture on the shape memory behaviour of micro-lattices. The sample microarchitecture is observed to affect the shape memory response significantly. The application of biomimicry to metal additive manufacturing is also explored. Here the fabrication of cellular material is performed whose design is inspired by nature. Cellular materials inspired by honeycomb show layer-by-layer fracture behaviour during compression testing leading to higher compressive strength and elongation. Another bio-inspired cellular material is a nested solid whose architecture mimics a spider web. Here materials fabrication is undertaken which absorbs a lot of energy with minimal load transmission. The last part of the seminar shall briefly highlight the microstructural investigation of high Mn steel by electron microscopy. The study proved the deformation of ε- martensite during cold rolling.

Abstract  Gas turbine engines in the turbine section operate at temperatures  exceeding 1300°C, which can cause high-temperature oxidation and reduce  the lifespan of turbine blades. To counter this, thermal barrier coating  (TBC) systems are employed, which not only provide thermal insulation  but should also possess mechanical durability, resist strain, and  prevent phase transitions. The TBC system comprises a bond coat,  thermally grown oxide, and ceramic topcoat. NiAl, an intermetallic  compound, is the main constituent of the bond coat and is crucial in the  aerospace industry. The study aims to investigate the mechanical  behaviour of NiAl by studying the effect of ternary and quaternary  additions of noble elements like Pt and Pd. The study involved preparing  alloys with varying Pt and Pd concentrations. Site occupancy studies  were carried out using XRD and DFT calculations. The results showed that  Pt and Pd strongly prefer to occupy the Ni sublattice in both  stoichiometric and Ni-rich NiAl due to their good bonding interaction  with Al, as revealed by density of states curves. The effects of  addition of Pt and Pd along with the stoichiometry and orientation on  the mechanical properties of NiAl-X alloys were also investigated using  high throughput nanoindentation techniques. The addition of Pt and Pd  was found to decrease the modulus and increase the metallic character of  bonding in NiAl, which was demonstrated through density states cal= culations. Elastic constants were obtained using the indentation modulus with the help of the theoretical model proposed by Vlassak  and Nix and compared with those obtained from DFT calculations and the  values were in reasonable agreement with each other. It was found that  the hardness of the alloys was dependent on their orientation and  stoichiometry, and the addition of Pt and Pd resulted in an increase in  hardness due to solid solution strengthening. The effect of temperature  on the nanoindentation hardness of the alloys was investigated up to  600°C. The study also investigates the effect of Pt and Pd on the  brittle to ductile transition temperature (BDTT) of stoichiometric NiAl.  To achieve this, binary, ternary (Ni-10Pt-50Al), and quaternary  (Ni-5Pt-5Pd-50Al) alloys were tested using uniaxial compression tests  performed up to 1000 °C. The results indicated that the addition of Pt  and Pt-Pd significantly increased the BDTT of NiAl.  ","categories": [],

In this context, it is worth to discuss about the fundamentals of these materials and taking into their technology aspects and applications. In the case of magnetic materials soft and rare earth permanent magnets keep their research live because of their need sustainable transport, The research  in soft magnetism is primarily focussing on developing new alloys with high saturation induction and low core loss which can surpass the properties of conventional Si-steel used for motor applications. On the other hand rare rare earth based magnets  such SmCo and Nd-Fe-B  hard magnets  are indispensable in strategic and modern industry needs. In recent times, the progress in Li-ion battery technology, especially among the electrode materials for high charge / discharge capabilities, is a great boom to Electric Vehicle / Hybrid electric vehicle sectors. The exploration of high-performance thermoelectric materials (TE) has attracted great attention from both an academic research perspective and with a view to industrial applications. Process and chemistry strategy is very important in developing TE materials with a high dimensionless figure of merits (ZT).I will give a few lectures focussing in detail on basics of the above materials, their processing and tuning of the functional properties for sustainable energy applications. Specifically, the impact of some of these materials on electric / hybrid vehicles technologies and on other energy saving applications will be discussed  ","categories": [],

He did his PhD in Materials Engineering at the City University of Hong Kong. His research focuses on interdisciplinary research areas of materials science for energy harvesting devices, biosensors, neuromorphic electronics and terahertz electronics. He has published over 30 articles in journals and filed 2 patents.   Abstract:  For decades, the widespread application of thermoelectric generators has been hampered by two major limitations: heat stagnation in their legs, which limits power conversion efficiency, and the inherent brittleness of their constituents, accelerating thermoelectric generator failure. While notable progress has been made in overcoming these fundamental flaws, the state-of-the-art still grapples with an apparent mismatch between thermoelectric performance and mechanical toughness. To enhance the power conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials and devices, we present various strategies involving defect engineering, interface engineering, and composite techniques. These strategies have been demonstrated across different families of thermoelectric materials, including metal chalcogenides, tetrahedrites, metal iodides, and other metal composites. Finally, we introduce sustainable large-scale development of thermoelectric modules using 3D printing technologies to achieve ultrahigh thermoelectric efficiencies.  ","categories": [],

HEOs were first reported in 2015, and over the last five years, the field has witnessed rapid growth. Within the framework of our research work, we have addressed several fundamental and applied aspects of HEOs, which have been pivotal in the development of this research topic. This presentation will initially focus on the discovery of HEO classes (and compositions) and their diverse synthesis routes. The extensive compositional flexibility of HEOs offers the possibility to tailor a plethora of functionalities. In this context, initial case studies pertaining to three unique/improved functionalities of HEOs, such as enhanced electrochemical cyclic stability, tunable optical properties, and exotic magneto-electronic properties, will be presented. Special emphasis will be placed on the electrochemical energy storage applications of HEOs, which appear to be a promising research direction. While these opportunities hold potential for future applications, researchers working on HEOs face multiple challenges in terms of precisely identifying the local atomistic features of HEOs. Hence, some of the possible approaches to tackle these challenges will be discussed. In summary, the presentation will provide an overview of the versatility of the multicomponent high entropy based design approach for engineering the structure and properties of oxide systems.

She graduated with a PhD in August 2022 from the Max-Planck-Institute for Iron Research in Dusseldorf, Germany where she worked in the Atom Probe Tomography group with Prof. Baptiste Gault. Her PhD thesis was based on examining the hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms in a high-manganese twinning induced plasticity steel by using correlative electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. She has a Masters degree in Materials Science through Erasmus Mundus Masters programme, thereby receiving joint Masters degree from two institutions: University of Montpellier, France and Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany. She studied Bachelor of Technology in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur, India.   Abstract:  High-manganese austenitic twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steels exhibit high strain hardening, high tensile strength and ductility, which make them promising materials for automotive and structural applications [1]. However, they are susceptible to oxidation [2] and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) during service loading conditions [3]. We investigated the influence of hydrogen on the dislocation structure in a model Fe-27Mn-0.3C (wt.%) TWIP steel. We observed the microstructural evolution from the formation of dislocation cells at 3% tensile strain to the formation of stacking faults at 7% tensile strain due to the presence of hydrogen. The associated deformation mechanisms will be discussed during the talk. We also investigated the mechanisms underpinning the oxidation and HE by atom probe tomography where we measured the segregation of hydrogen and oxygen at grain boundaries. We studied the role of carbon and manganese in the oxidation and HE susceptibility which are major alloying elements in TWIP steels. This study motivated the design of a carbon austenitic steel which has higher resistance to HE. The results on TWIP steel and the carbon austenitic steel will be presented in details during this presentation. References [1] B.C. De Cooman, O. Kwon, K.G. Chin, Mater. Sci.

The evolution in HEA design from entropy-centric to phase-centric changed the focus from HEA to complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) and displayed stability of either of three major phases namely f.c.c., h.c.p. and b.c.c. solid solutions with minor presence of high entropy intermetallic phases in alloy microstructure. With time, the design philosophy of CCAs is termed differently such as equiatomic, eutectic, metastable, and flexible which mainly show synergistic use of fundamental metallurgical principles with CCA theory for the design of respective alloys. In line with that, the present work attempts the design of next-generation complex concentrated alloys for four main categories of metals/alloys namely Fe, Ti, Cu, and Ni/Co based alloys. The design of Fe containing HEA displayed multifunctionality by having five properties (formability, strength-ductility synergy, fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, and electrical resistivity) better/comparable than its steel counterparts whereas Ti containing as-cast HEA for the first time revealed more than 50 % tensile elongation while having more than 90% compressive formability with an exceptional specific strength. Co and Ni containing HEA showed remarkable high temperature oxidation resistance and specific strength at temperatures greater than 800 Deg C in spite of the absence of any refractory element in the alloy whereas Cu containing complex alloy demonstrated extreme strength-ductility synergy by two phases strengthening as a result of prevalent spinodal decomposition in the alloy. Thus, current work provides a new direction in designing future complex alloys and making them closer to use in structural applications in a much cost-effective way.  ","categories": [],

Alternative approaches based on biophysical antibacterial  mechanisms can be the dark horse in the fight against antimicrobial  resistance, however, successful translation and commercially viable  widespread adoption is dependent on clear understanding of the key  bactericidal mechanisms and development of cheap, scalable  nanofabrication strategies. To this end, in this work, high aspect ratio  nanostructures are fabricated on titanium using dry etching in plasma  and it is demonstrated that the nanostructure formation takes place due  to micro-masking of the titanium surface with chemical species generated  during the etch process. Furthermore, etching recipes are developed for  titanium and poly (ethylene terephthalate) based on studies of the  effects of several process parameters in dry etching, which are used to  fabricate nanostructures with extremely high aspect ratios to study  their bactericidal efficacy. It is shown that an increase in aspect  ratio affects the nanomechanical properties of the structures and leads  to formation of superstructures which can affect their bactericidal  efficacy. Moreover, external capillary forces are shown to be capable of  enhancing the killing efficiency by exerting a downward force on the  bacterial cells. Finally, metal oxide nanotubes generated by  electrochemical anodization are demonstrated to be equally effective as  nanopillars in eliminating bacteria, but with the additional benefit of  scalability, low cost, and the ability to generate such topographies on  complex, 3D geometries.

A typical TBC is made of two layers: an oxidation resistant bond coat such as diffusion aluminide or overlay MCrAlY coating, and a ceramic top coat, typically yittria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ). While oxidation and corrosion protection are the key function of bond coats, their mechanical behaviour play a key role in the spallation of the TBC, particularly in thermal cycling scenario like those in aircraft engines. The cyclic thermal loading leads to undulation at the bond coat surface known as rumpling. However, limited information on the thermos-mechanical properties is available in literature. Attempts to measure these properties have been inhibited by the limited thickness of these coatings. Studies to measure these properties using ingots cast with the same chemical composition are undermined by the fact that the microstructure of the bond coat is substantially different than that of the casting. In the present study, a small-scale testing method based on digital image correlation is performed. This testing method is first validated and then used to characterize the thermo-mechanical properties of NiCoCrAlY (MCrAlY type) of bond coats. Properties like CTE, Modulus, Poisson’s ratio, creep parameters are obtained. The technique used for deposition of bond coat can also play an important role in the mechanical properties. A comparative study of the mechanical behaviour of two popular process of deposition: 1) High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF), and 2) Vacuum Plasma Spray process is discussed.

While organic semiconductors offer flexibility and processability at lower temperatures, their performance and air stability are typically limited. In contrast, inorganic two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit properties conducive to the next generation large-area and flexible devices, including appropriate band gaps, intrinsic flexibility, and the availability of both n-type and p-type semiconductors.   Various techniques exist for the large-scale synthesis of 2D materials, with chemical and physical vapor deposition imposing substrate limitations, due to high process temperatures required. Conversely, solution-based techniques provide substrate flexibility with the process temperature being generally low. When integrated with printing, solution-based techniques can allow roll-to-roll processing of electronic devices through which we can even realize disposable electronics.   With the above motivation, there are several reports on solution processed transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD, such as MoS2, WS2 etc.) transistors. However, the performance falls short because of the presence of inter-flake resistance between the flakes. The inter-flake junction is an integral part of thin films deposited from solution-processed two-dimensional materials. It is characterized by very poor electronic transport, which is not tunable electrostatically. This resistance ends up determining the device properties rather than the intrinsic properties of the semiconducting material itself.   In this regard, this dissertation work addresses this bottleneck by presenting methods to achieve high-performance 2D transistors and circuits. The first chapter introduces an innovative device geometry that can convert inter-flake transport to predominantly intra-flake, utilizing a near-vertical device architecture. Hence, instead of having charge transport along the printed semiconductor film laterally, we observe nearvertical carrier transport through the semiconductor film, drastically reducing the number of junctions, which makes the device performance close to that of the single-flake device. Inkjet-printed n-type MoS2 transistors, utilizing this geometry, achieve a high electron current density of 300 μA.μm-1 and an On-Off ratio of 106. Interestingly, we have also observed gate tunable capacitance modulation, which results in subthermionic transport and a low subthreshold swing of 7.5 mV.decade-1.   In the second chapter, exploiting the predominant intra-flake transport, we fabricate logic circuits from printed 2D transistors. Initially, unipolar depletion-mode inverters are shown with a maximum gain of 31 and dynamic power consumption below 15 nW. Next, we also demonstrate NOR, AND, NAND, and OR gates operating at 1 kHz. Moreover, we show the possibility of doping and contact resistance modulation in the printed devices, which are otherwise not conceivable in the presence of inter-flake resistance limited devices.   In the third chapter, by capitalizing on the novel device architecture, we fabricate complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. The first target was to realize p-type 2D transistors, for which we utilized mono elemental Te as the semiconductor material. Here, we have achieved a high current density of 100 μA.μm-1, maintaining an On-Off ratio of 105. These p-type transistors, along with n-type MoS2 transistors, are then used to fabricate CMOS transistors. We could show a maximum gain of 11 at a mere supply voltage of 1.5 V. Also, it is shown to respond rail-to-rail at an AC input frequency of 1 kHz.   In the fourth and last chapter, we exploit the 1T metallic and 2H semiconducting polymorph of MoS2 to show high-performance devices in a lateral geometry itself. By inducing a metallic nature in the semiconducting flakes, we demonstrate it is possible to outdo the inter-flake resistance in a printed film when most of the flakes are metallic in nature, where the transport is controlled by the semiconducting flakes placed in between. Fascinatingly, we could show devices that can be fabricated at room temperature without needing surface treatment. In this chapter, we show fully-printed thin fil,m transistors (TFTs) on a paper substrate utilizing screen-printed 2D Mxene, Ti3C2 as the metal electrodes, and inkjet printed MoS2 as the semiconductor material. This work demonstrates that it is possible to fabricate fully-printed high performance electronics with 2D materials.  ","categories": [],

Additional  microstructural terms influencing creep such as the grain size and  stacking fault energy (γ) have been incorporated into the creep equation  in a power-law form, such as ε ̇∝γ^q. In the case of an intragranular  dislocation climb controlled creep in a solid solution alloy, the creep  rate has been expressed as ε ̇∝Dσ^5 γ^3, where D is the appropriate  diffusion coefficient, n~5 and q~3. However, an evaluation of the  earlier creep data suggests that while q~3 is reasonable for pure  metals, there is considerable uncertainty in the value of q for solid  solution alloys.  The current study focuses on characterizing the creep behavior and the  value of q for Ni – xCo alloys, with x = 10, 33, and 60, where the  addition of Co reduces the stacking fault energy. Following creep in  Ni-Co alloys, the creep behaviour of CSSAs NiCoCr and NiCoCrFe was also  investigated to probe potential changes in the creep mechanisms with the  addition of alloying element. All alloys are single phase solid  solutions with a face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) crystal structure. Prior  to the creep, all alloys had a grain size d~100 µm. The observed  stacking fault energies through weak beam dark field technique are 10 –  36 mJ m-2 for Ni – 60 Co, 14 – 27 mJ m-2 for NiCoCr, and 11 – 26 mJ m-2  for NiCoCrFe alloys. At a creep testing temperature of 1015 K, the  stress exponent n ~ 5 for binary Ni – Co alloys, suggesting that  dislocation climb is the creep rate controlling mechanism. The cell  structure observed through electron channel contrast imaging in the  crept samples of the alloys is consistent with a dislocation climb  mechanism. The stacking fault energy exponent q ~ 2 in Ni– (x) Co binary  solid solution alloys.  At 990 K, the creep rates of the NiCoCr and NiCoCrFe alloys were  observed to be similar with a stress exponent n~5. Both the ternary and  quaternary alloys showed significantly lower creep rates compared to the  Ni – (x) Co binary alloys. Creep deformation did not cause any phase  change in the NiCoCrFe alloy. Although the Ni – (x) Co alloys, NiCoCr,  and NiCoCrFe alloys exhibited a similar stress exponent of n~5, the  crept substructure in the NiCoCr and NiCoCrFe alloy showed planar band  features.  The possible causes for the observed differences in creep  behavior between the Ni-Co binary alloys and the other concentrated  solid solution alloys will be discussed.  ","categories": [],

This study investigates the correlation between mi= crostructure and corrosion properties in SnCr and CuCr electrodeposited coatings. The wide immiscibility of SnCr and CuCr systems  would facilitate chromium’s segregation in the high energy grain  boundary regions, enhancing the corrosion resistance due to the forma= tion of the stable Cr2O3 phase. The first part of the study was focused on developing SnCr and CuCr coatings with varying Cr  content. Microstructural analysis using STEM revealed Cr segregation at  the grain boundaries of the matrix phases, along with the evolution of  solid solution SnCr and CuCr phases. For both SnCr and CuCr coatings,  the corrosion rate (determined using Potentiodynamic Polarization and  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) varied non-monotonically with Cr  concentration, and at an optimum Cr concentration, the highest corrosion  resistance was achieved. Higher corrosion resistance at lower Cr  concentrations was attributed to Cr-oxide formation and the evolution of  low-energy surface texture and grain boundary constitution. The higher  corrosion rate at higher Cr additions was primarily due to increased  coating strain. In the second part of the work, the SnCr and CuCr  coatings with the lowest corrosion rate were co-deposited with graphene  oxide (GO) as reinforcement. The corrosion rate of the coatings was  sensitive to the volume fraction of the added GO, and at an optimum  volume fraction, the lowest corrosion rate was noticed. The corrosion  resistance improvement was due to the impermeable and inert nature of  the GO sheets. The incorporation of GO promoted SnCr coating growth  along the low energy (100) plane, while in the case of CuCr coating,  surface texture revealed dominant low energy (111) planes. GO also i= ncreased the fraction of low energy low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and coincidence site lattices (CSLs) in both coating  systems, thereby enhancing corrosion resistance. A high GO concentration  led to high corrosion rates in composite coatings primarily because of  the agglomeration of GO and potential galvanic coupling between the  anodic metallic matrix and the cathodic GO sheets. The third part of the  work involved the investigation of the effect of the deposition  temperature (15ºC - 45ºC) on the microstructure and corrosion behaviour  of electrodeposited SnCr and CuCr coatings. The low electrodeposition  temperature (15ºC) yielded coating with the lowest corrosion rate. The  surface morphology of the coatings exhibited significant changes because  of variations in the deposition temperature. This effect can be  attributed to the alterations in deposition kinetics, which, in turn,  influenced the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the coatings. The  coating grain size decreased with a decrease in the deposition  temperature. For the SnCr system, the preferred orientation along the  low energy (100) plane, a high fraction of LAGBs, and low average strain  within the grains gave rise to better corrosion resistance. Similarly,  for the CuCr system, 15°C coating exhibited higher corrosion resistance  due to (111) preferred orientation, smaller grain size, increased CSL  boundaries, and Ʃ3 coherent twin boundaries.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. Hirendra Nath Ghosh  Director, National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) Bhubaneshwar, India.   When?  8th December, 2023 (Friday), 4.00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  K I Vasu Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore   Abstract:  Metal chalcogenides are the potential competitors to traditional crystalline silicon solar cells owing to their unique properties such as high abundance, high absorption coefficients (104 -105 cm-1), tunable bandgap, cost-effectiveness, and robust stability. However, their performance is constrained by challenges such as rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and inadequate band edge potentials. To address these limitations, p-n heterojunctions, where a high-bandgap n-type semiconductor is combined with a low-bandgap p-type semiconductor, have emerged as a highly promising approach. This approach facilitates the creation of reliable and efficient photonic devices capable of harnessing a broader spectrum of solar radiation. These junctions serve as the main active sites for efficient charge transfer processes, ensuring rapid separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers due to the built-in electric field. Furthermore, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the optical and material properties of these heterojunction systems, it is imperative to investigate the ultrafast processes involved such as charge transfer, trapping, and relaxation dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes. To this end, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy has been employed as a valuable tool. We have investigated the charge transfer dynamics at the interface of p-type copper, antimony, tin chalcogenides (Cu2ZnSnX4, CuX, SnX, Sb2X3, CuInX2: X=S, Se,) and n-type cadmium chalcogenides (CdX, X=S, Se) which is widely used in solar cell technology and photocatalysis. By probing into these ultrafast processes, research efforts aim to unlock opportunities for the development of highly efficient photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices, thereby contributing to the mitigation of energy and environmental challenges.

This presentation will address research of our team in area of new high thermal conductivity composites based on urania, thoria and silicates and uranium and thorium. Presented work is both experimental and theoretical.

Single-phase FCC alloys have especially attracted significant scientific attention, with several alloys from the Cantor (Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni) system exhibiting excellent mechanical properties at room temperature and 77 K. Based on these results, predictions were made about the cryogenic behavior of equiatomic CrCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi. These predictions are evaluated through deformation experiments carried out at 4 K. The active deformation mechanisms are identified using SEM and TEM and correlated with work-hardening rate variations. The differences between the reportedly low stacking fault energy (SFE) CrCoNi and medium SFE CrMnFeCoNi are illustrated, with multiple assertions/predictions being refuted, including expectations of martensite formation and contribution to strengthening. Contrastingly a non-equiatomic, expectedly high SFE, multicomponent alloy (Fe40Ni11Mn35Al8Cr6)C1 was chosen to evaluate deformation behavior in the same temperature range. This alloy was not expected to exhibit deformation twinning or martensite formation, unlike the previous two alloys, but microband-induced plasticity. Surprisingly, it exhibits deformation twinning as well as microband formation at cryogenic temperatures. This conflicting combination is reconciled as a result of solid solution strengthening and its effect as a function of temperature. The effect of solid solution strengthening in this case far surpasses even that in CrMnFeCoNi.  ","categories": [],

The Hall-Petch scaling breaks down at grain sizes below » 10nm. The dominant deformation mechanism in the Hall-Petch breakdown or grain boundary weakening regime are not well-understood, with weakening being attributed variously to diffusion creep, grain rotation, and grain boundary sliding. Typically, specimens with the finest grain sizes are annealed to obtain the coarser grain sizes, and the influence of such annealing on strength is not clear. Several studies have attributed the grain boundary weakening regime to enhanced grain boundary segregation or reduced internal stresses caused by annealing. This study focuses on characterizing the dominant deformation mechanisms in the Hall-Petch breakdown regime. The Ni-W system was chosen as the model alloy, where W is known to segregate at the grain boundary. The Hall-Petch behaviour was studied using nanoindentation hardness measurements, and the hardness observed in Ni-W alloys (3-15 %W) ranged from 6 to 15 GPa for grain sizes from 29 nm down to 3 nm. Solute segregation was studied extensively to understand the role of solute chemistry at the GB, using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) experiments. Three alloys with 3, 8 and 15 at% W were studied. Different grain sizes were obtained at a constant W content by annealing at various temperatures. A clear Hall-Petch breakdown was observed in the three compositions. Measurements revealed that solute segregation did not increase upon annealing, so that the GB weakening regime cannot be attributed to variations in segregation. Annealing introduces multiple microstructural changes simultaneously and it is difficult to separate the contribution from each process. Four alloys with W content 19 ± 1 at% and grain sizes ranging from 8 to 3 nm were synthesized by slightly modifying the deposition conditions, without annealing. A clear grain boundary weakening regime was observed, suggesting that the grain boundary weakening regime is not related solely to annealing effects. The wear behavior was also studied for a 8nm Ni-W alloy deposited on ball-bearing steel used in one of the EOS satellites at ISRO. The wear of ball-bearings limits the life of these satellites. The Ni-W coatings were examined for better wear resistance. The cross-sectional hardness measured for an annealed alloy of 11 nm grain size was » 22 GPa. A fivefold increase in the wear resistance was observed compared to current steel, suggesting the viability of such coatings for improving the life of satellites.  ","categories": [],

Although ion beam irradiation cannot completely duplicate the irradiation conditions in neutron irradiation, it allows for the study of fundamental processes due to radiation damage at high doses, which are not achievable in practical time scales in neutron irradiation. This method also obviates the problem of radioactivity that is encountered in neutron irradiated samples. Ion irradiation experiments can cause damage similar to that found in the nuclear reactors, such as voids, bubbles, dislocation loops, vacancy and interstitial clusters, and other defects. Such damage causes an increase in strength and is usually accompanied by a decrease in ductility, which is extremely deleterious to the service properties of these materials in a reactor environment. However, one of the main issues faced in characterizing the effects of such damage arising out of ion irradiation is that it is confined to a small layer near the surface of the sample, typically ranging from a few hundred nm to a few microns. In this talk, the speaker will endeavour to show the various approaches used to evaluate the mechanical property changes in materials affected by ion irradiation, utilizing different techniques such as electron microscopy, nanoindentation and in situ micromechanical testing. Some interesting results and case studies will also be considered, which will help illuminate the phenomena occurring during the irradiation process, and show the utility of the micromechanical testing methods adopted here for evaluating ion irradiated materials.

While empirical constraints are in place to design compositions and limit spinel crystallization, and empirical models are in place to predict the behavior of the compositions, there are always some compositions whose behavior is beyond the predictive ability of the models. My Ph.D. study was an in-depth investigation of the chemo structural descriptors controlling the crystallization behavior in these glasses. It primarily focused on (i) the impact of non-framework cation mixing and (ii) the impact of mixed-network former effect on the structure and crystallization of glasses in the system Na2O - Al2O3 - B2O3 - SiO2 - Fe2O3 - MnO - NiO - Cr2O3 where Fe2O3 = 9 mol%. (iii) Iron redox kinetics in various compositional regimes of interest. A suite of characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Raman spectroscopy, magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, and Mössbauer spectroscopy were employed. The studies suggest that (i) generally, the tendency to crystallize increases when Na+ is replaced with Li+ or Ca2+ i.e higher field cation, and, the tendency to crystallize also increases with (ii) increasing Al2O3/SiO2 and B2O3/SiO2 ratios, which correlates to the preferential charge compensation of the Na+ amongst the tetrahedral network forming units (Al, B, Fe) in the order Al &gt; B &gt; Fe, and further leads to an increase in Fe2+/ΣFe and, (iii) resultant unmixing of the aluminoborosilicate network leads to the preferential ion enrichment in the solution favorable to crystallization.   Biosketch:  In pursuit of my interests in Materials, Mechanics, and Design, I obtained a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Later, I pursued M.Tech in Materials Sciences at IIT-Kanpur where I worked on synthesizing and electrically characterizing chalcogenide thin films towards understanding the switching rates eventually developing a high-performance, scalable solid-state device. Moving forward, as a Materials Scientist at the R&amp;D center of the Aditya Birla Group, I worked on the synthesis and development of a novel cement product. I also worked on the material modeling of high-strength concrete and fracture analysis of its pre-cast structures. With an interest in amorphous materials, later, at Rutgers- The State University of New Jersey, my Ph.D. research focused on understanding the impact of melt chemistry, structure, and iron-redox on spinel crystallization in iron-rich nuclear wastes under the guidance of Prof. Ashutosh Goel. A suite of Characterization techniques including Raman spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and high-field high-speed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) amongst others was employed. The results of the investigation have made it abundantly clear that the alkali and alkaline earth cations with higher ionic field strength promoted crystallization. While the clustered iron-rich regions provided a lower energy path for spinel crystallization, the degree of heterogeneity in the network was found to control crystallization. The empirical relationships that are believed to represent compositional control of crystallization in the regimes of interest to the nuclear waste community are further refined by the results obtained from the study. Currently, I am working as a Glass melting process engineer/Development scientist at Corning Incorporated where I apply rigorous scientific techniques and methods to (i) improve glass melting process capability and (ii) develop incremental technology to mitigate and/or optimize existing process systems in manufacturing. I love to cook and please my taste buds as well as others’ too. I paint and sketch whenever possible. Badminton and Hindu philosophical texts are some of my other interests.  ","categories": [],

We first illustrate this with exotic ferroelectricity in HfO2, which has the potential to be useful in the development of ultimately high-density memory chips. We then present an analysis of entropic stabilization and descriptors of structural transition in a high entropy alloy NbHfZrTi, demonstrating how the internal lattice distortions peak at the transition. The flexibility of geometrically interesting framework crystals, such as metal-organic frameworks, is important to their applications. While closely linked to rigidity, a precise measure if flexibility has been lacking. We present a quantitative measure of mechanical flexibility and uncover its mechanisms from the analysis of different types of crystalline materials.

A thermosetting polymercontains a permanent crosslinked network and is one that undergoes degradation without goingthrough fluid state on heating at high temperatures. This in turn dramatically reduces its durability and longevitywhich persuades the requirement of disposing it in landfillsor incineration leadingto environmental pollutionand difficulty in waste management. Unfortunately, this disposal strategy attributes to the rising dangers and concerns for the environment. Epoxy resins are thermosetting polymeric liquids that are viscous and contain epoxides in their chemical structure. Its properties such as light weight, good adhesion, high moisture and chemical resistance, strong durability at high and low temperatures, low shrinkage and great mechanical properties makes it a desirablematrix use in various applications. There is an increasing need for sustainable polymeric materials that not only exceed strict performance requirements but also have the capacity to be recycledand reprocessed in severaldifferent industries, including aerospace, automotive, transportation, and medical. In recent times, the emergence of vitrimers with self-healing technology has sparked significant interest in exploring innovative approaches for self-healing on the interface as well as bulk phenomena. This area shows great promise and potentialfor advancements in various fields. Vitrimers have become a potential class of polymers because of these demands. Unlike other materials, vitrimershave dynamic covalentcrosslinks that enable temperature-dependent exchange kinetics. This property enables vitrimers to behave like thermoplastics that can be reprocessed at high temperatures alongwith retaining and accomplishing the desired resistance to chemical and mechanical stress comparable to thermosets at the application temperatures. These unconventional polymer networks rely on dynamic bonds that can react reversibly, namely covalentadaptable networks (CANs).The CANs could release stress from deformation, allowing the crosslinked polymers to be reprocessed, reshaped,and recycled. The heavy amounts of stress, force, high temperature, and pressure in various applications that the material is subjected to results in cracks and fractures and consequently the life of the materialis shortened. In this thesis, we have successfully synthesized single, dual and tripledynamic CANs to design epoxy based Vitrimer. The resulting Vitrimer cure within 2 hours in contrast to traditional epoxies which take typically 12-14 hours to completely cure. The resulting epoxy vitrimers exhibited high tensile strength, exceptionally high Tg, fast stress relaxation and high an activation energy. Due to the pre-installed CAN, they show flow induced activation and can change network topology triggered by temperature. Such materials could widely be used in various applications in automobile, aerospace technology etc where frequent maintenance is required and in addition can be recycled due to the presence of dynamic bonds. This thesis systematically evaluates the self-healing, reusability and re-processability, triggered by the exchangeable bonds, in the epoxy Vitrimer.  ","categories": [],

Zafir Alam)   When?  24th January, 2024 (Wednesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Pt-aluminide (PtAl) bond coat is used as a part of Thermal Barrier  Coating (TBC) system on Ni-base superalloy components in advanced gas  turbine aeroengines. The thickness of B2-NiAl intermetallic based  diffused coating varies in the range of 60-100 µm. The coating provides  excellent protection against oxidation to the superalloy components  experiencing extreme temperatures of 1000°C during the operation of  aeroengine. High temperatures combined with fluctuating mechanical loads  can induce fatigue damage in the coating during service. Damage  initiated in diffused coating propagates into the superalloy substrate  and causes failure of the components. Therefore, evaluation of  micro-mechanical properties of the PtAl bond coat is essential from the  scientific and engineering application standpoints. The present study  evaluates fatigue behavior of freestanding PtAl coating in the  temperature range of ambient to 1000°C. Testing of the coating in  freestanding form provides scientific understanding of inherent fatigue  behavior and the evolution of fatigue damage in the coating without any  influence from the substrate. Detailed microstructural characterization of the fatigue tested coating  microsamples using SEM-EBSD, XRM and TEM has been carried out to  ascertain the fatigue damage mechanisms in the coating. In the  temperature regime of ambient to 800°C, high dislocation activity,  formation of dislocation cells and dislocation-precipitate interactions  induce strain hardening in the coating. The failure of the coating  occurs by the formation of micro-voids due to de-cohesion of  precipitate/B2-matrix interface in the heavily precipitated i= nterdiffusion zone (IDZ), subsequent formation of micro-cracks by coalescence of micro-voids, and final failure by propagation of  micro-cracks. On the other hand, the coating exhibits extensive voiding,  preferentially within its fine-grained outer layer, during fatigue  deformation at temperatures of 900°C and beyond. The voids in the outer  layer are primarily induced by creep. Cyclic loading leads to the  formation of microcracks from these voids, and final failure is caused  by the propagation of cracks. The deflection of crack across the coating  layers and blunting of the crack tip in the IDZ layer delay the fatigue  crack propagation.  ","categories": [],

Lower processing temperature causes difficulty  in recrystallization of these alloys especially in two-phase conditions.  However, processing in this regime is important for achieving  microstructural control for the desired mechanical properties.  Furthermore, most of the studies in this field are either in single  phase β or about the globularization behavior of mostly α-laths in the  (α+β) regions. Hence, there is dearth of information on the  microstructural state and role of the β-phase during deformation in  these conditions. Therefore, aim of the present investigation is to  address the gaps in literature pertaining to recrystallization behavior  of α and β phases during hot deformation of near β - and metastable β-  titanium alloys in (α+β) phase field.  To achieve the above-mentioned goals in the present work, a metastable β  titanium alloy, Ti10V-2Fe-3Al, and a near β titanium alloy, SP-700, both  with lamellar starting microstructure, have been subjected to uniaxial  compression tests in (α+β) regions as function of temperature and strain  rate to optimize the primary processing conditions. Subsequently, the  alloys were hot rolled up to 90 pct. in the (α+β) region followed by  static annealing as a function of temperature and time to elucidate the  microstructural and textural evolution in finally processed condition.  In these conditions, the most relevant properties were evaluated for the  two alloys, namely, fatigue crack growth (FCG) for Ti-10-2-3 alloy and,  superplastic behaviour for the SP-700 alloy.  While kinking and bending is the dominat mechanism in globularization of  α phase; grains are formed through CDRX mechanism in the β-phase for  both the alloys at lower temperature and at lower strain rate. The best  processing conditions were identified that led to DRX of α and β phases  through the strain rate sensitivity maps, for both the alloys.  Signatures of the deformation texture were observed in the α and β  phases of both the alloys in all the annealed conditions. Grain boundary  sliding was found to be one of the dominant deformation mechanisms  during superplastic testing of the SP-700 alloy.  ","categories": [],

This alloy was processed by  quasi-constrained HPT by applying a pressure of 6 GPa at room  temperature for 1, 2, and 5 turns. Samples processed to two turns of HPT  showed the smallest grain size, the highest strength that was  approximately five times higher than the as-received coarse-grained  sample and a reduction in the ductility. Electrochemical impedance  spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization demonstrated the highest  corrosion resistance for the Mg-alloy processed for two turns of HPT;  however, accelerated degradation due to pitting corrosion was observed  after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for three days.  Nevertheless, all HPT-processed samples showed lower corrosion rates in  all corrosion tests compared to their annealed counterparts. Finally,  cell culture revealed good cytocompatibility without any noticeable  changes in cytotoxicity following HPT processing. Overall, HPT for two  turns showed enhanced strength and reduced corrosion rates without loss  in cytocompatibility for the Mg-6Zn-0.2Ce alloy, making it a promising  strategy to enhance the performance of the alloy as a bioresorbable  orthopedic biomaterial.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Inkjet-printed high performance oxide electronics and its application at  sensor interfaces   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Subho Dasgupta   When?  08th February, 2024 (Thurssday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Printed electronics is a rapidly maturing field of research, where  printed, high throughput fabrication of electronic devices/ components  on various rigid/ flexible substrates are aimed at. Over the last two  decades, printing of oxide semiconductors has attracted particular  attention for their possible applications in a variety of application  domain, such as, sensors, thin film transistors (TFTs) and circuits,  photodetectors, photovoltaics etc. Although oxide semiconductors can be  very attractive choice, however, fully-printed circuits based on oxide  semiconductors have rarely been reported in the literature; one of the  major challenge here is the absence of a performance-matched high  mobility p-type (hole conducting) oxide semiconductor. In this regard,  in this PhD dissertation, the performance and capacity of printed  all-NMOS unipolar pseudo-CMOS technology based circuits are evaluated.  At first, the deep subthreshold regime of amorphous indium-gallium zinc  oxide (a-IGZO) TFTs has been exploited to fabricate pseudo-CMOS  inverters, ring oscillators and static random access memories (SRAMs).  In this case, a composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) has been used  as the gate insulator and the individual a-IGZO TFTs have resulted in  superior device mobility values. The fabricated pseudo-CMOS design  2T-depletion type and 4T-depletion type inverters thus produced have  demonstrated an unprecedented voltage gain (Av) of 284 and 325,  respectively, at very low operating voltage of 2 V. On the other hand,  single inverters and ring oscillators have also been tested for AC  performance and found to demonstrate a switching speed up to 30 kHz.  Next, even when based on pseudo-CMOS technology, the inverters have  shown low static power consumption in the range of few hundreds of  nanowatts. While the observed results are significantly superior when  compared to the state of the art in printed electronics, it also paves  way for many applications in the portable, wearable electronics domain,  including interface circuits for sensors, displays etc.  Next, fully-printed and further complex circuit elements have been  planned and realized using an identical low voltage operated, ele= ctrolyte-gated and a-IGZO based deep sub-threshold operable TFT technology. The TFTs have been further optimized to demonstrate  remarkably high ON/OFF current ratio as well as low subthreshold slope  near to Boltzmann’s limit (58 mV/decade) at room temperature, which is  necessary for the detection of weak biological/electrophysiological  signals that are in the µV range. Here, at first, the fabricated  pseudo-CMOS inverters with high voltage gain and noise margin are used  to fabricate common-source and differential amplifiers that can amplify  a small signal (mV range) to a large signal (Volt range) within a  suitable frequency range up to 1 kHz. Next, fully-printed circuits  consisting of amplifiers along with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)  have been realized that can interface with sensors and show the analog  to digital conversion of the input analog signal. Moreover, the entire  circuit is found capable of operating at a low supply voltage of ≤ 2 V,  and can be used for fully-printed sensor patches along with readout  electronics to detect physical, chemical or biological signals.  Finally, an effort has been made to improve further important/ key  parameters of a TFT such as transconductance and subthreshold slope, a  new device concept, known as negative capacitance field-effect  transistor (nc-FET) has been realized. This device concept follows  completely different device architecture from conventional MOSFETs,  where the gate insulator becomes a combination of dielectric and a  ferroelectric layer placed in a series. With this combination, the  negative differential capacitance behaviour of a ferroelectric-gated TFT  can be stabilized over a large frequency range. The concepts works  similar to a step-up transformer placed inside the device that can  result in a rate of change of semiconductor surface potential to be  higher than the change in the applied gate potential, i.e. the body  factor (m) of the transistor to be less than 1 (m&lt;(&gt;«)&gt; 1). This can  translate to the sub-threshold slope of the device to be substantially  less than the Boltzmann’s limit (58 mV/decade) at room temperature. With  this device geometry, the TFTs can perform way superior in terms of  rapid switching, which would translate to enormous signal gain (η). The  total dynamic power consumption should also reduce drastically even when  all-NMOS unipolar logic is used. While, the nc-FET device concept is  novel and largely interesting, it has never been reported till date for  fully solution-processed or printed transistors. In this regard, fully  printed nc-FETs could have been demonstrated combining printed a-IGZO  semiconductor channel, Al2O3 as the dielectric PVDF-TrFE (70/30) as the  ferroelectric layer. The printed devices have shown truly  metal-insulator type transition with subthreshold slope of 2.3 mV/dec.  while the printed depletion-load type inverters have demonstrated  gigantic signal gain, as large as η= 2691, along with a few nanowatts  (nW) of dynamic power consumption. Interestingly, the nc-FETs have also  exhibited memory behaviour with capacity of holding the state of the  device for up to 10^6 seconds.  ","categories": [],

While organic pollutants occur naturally, the rise in    anthropogenic and geogenic activities has contributed to an increase  in   inorganic pollutants in groundwater resources. These toxic  by-products   should be detected and remedied from the start of the  polluting source   itself before it reaches out to the ecosystem.  Monitoring these   inorganic pollutants is imperative to avoid their  adverse impacts on   ecological and human health. Thus far, variegated  detection systems  have  been reported; however, restricted selectivity,  specificity and   uncompetitive lower limit of detection impede their  extensive   deployment. Additionally, sophisticated, and advanced  instruments   available for the identification of heavy-metal toxins  require skilled   technicians for appropriate interpretation.    Although the traditional colourimetric and/or fluorimetric methods of    detecting these analytes are common, there is an underlying hindrance   in  the detection limit, and ease of usage.  Contextually, solid-state    sensors are a better alternative as they operate on low power, provide   a  better detection limit and have higher reliability. To this extent,   my  thesis focuses on the design and testing of solid-state sensors to    detect analytes such as nitrates, fluorides, and the mutagenic    carcinogenic heavy metal hexavalent chromium.    Metal-oxide-based solid-state sensors have often exhibited a lack of    selectivity and specificity. Hence, the work presented here explores a    low-cost alternative viz., bandgap engineered organic conjugated    molecular sensors. Biomimetic-based molecular architecturing of a    thiourea-based carbon nanocomposite has been developed to selectively    detect nitrate ions in water with a detection limit of 10 ppm. The    device architecture is that of a chemiresistor. The notorious  inorganic   contaminant, nitrate, has a high interference from fluoride  ion.   Consequently, a selective fluoride sensor has also been reported,  which   shows a limited response to nitrate ions. A statistical    dimensional-reduction method called ‘Principal Component Analysis’   (PCA)  has been employed to achieve pattern recognition by minimising   the loss  of data.    Furthermore, fluorimetric and solid-state sensing methods have been    established to detect mutagenic hexavalent chromium. The fluorimetric    titration method has shown a detection limit of 9µM and this was   further  improved by fabricating a carbon-nanocomposite-based  thick-film   chemiresistive sensor, with a limit of detection of 1 ppm.  The   solid-state sensor reported for this purpose employs a  ‘doctor-blading’   technique to achieve enhanced response, in addition  to high reliability   and repeatability.    We have then developed a lesser-explored phenolphthalein-structured    Schiff base molecular library for the objective study of colourimetric    and fluorimetric detection of iron and hexavalent chromium,    respectively. Molecular simulations have been carried out for the   ground  state geometrical optimizations; bandgap is determined through   TDDFT  calculations using Gaussian software.  ","categories": [],

However, there are instances where external intervention becomes necessary to support the body’s innate healing mechanism. In this thesis, four such unmet clinical challenges were identified: rapid blood clotting, personalized treatment of burns and chronic wounds, and stretchable implants. Herein, we present novel solutions utilizing silk protein in various formats, each serving a distinct purpose in its respective application. Silk protein (silk fibroin) is being leveraged as a promising biomaterial with potent wound-healing activity. The first experimental chapter describes efforts to develop a potent hemostat for hemorrhage control. The primary goal was to develop a first-aid product for use in a pre-hospital setting where professional healthcare providers are not readily available (such as for battlefield injuries, road accidents, etc.). Herein, a bilayered hemostatic foam was designed such that the top bioactive layer served as a tissue interfacial layer to minimize rebleeding without compromising the clotting abilities. The subsequent two chapters describe strategies for personalized treatment of difficult-to-heal wounds: burns and chronic wounds. It is crucial to recognize that every patient and wound type is unique and requires individualized attention and care. To this end, two dressing materials were developed: a hydrogel-based dressing for burns and a multifunctional bioceramic-based drug delivery platform for chronic wounds. These dressing materials were specially designed for point-of-care applications and personalized treatment. Notably, the in vivo studies revealed the superior healing efficacy of the burn dressing compared to the commercially available product. Moreover, the multifunctional bioceramic-based product exhibited promising antioxidant and antibacterial properties, making it a potential candidate for chronic wounds. The last part of the thesis introduces ultra-stretchable 3D printed biocompatible hydrogels.   Herein, a ternary blend ink was carefully formulated for extrusion-based 3D printing. The developed hydrogel presented superior mechanical properties, including good stretchability and fatigue performance. These mechanically robust hydrogels have potential applications in stretchable implants, bioelectronics, and flexible wearables. This thesis was accomplished through a collaborative effort with Fibroheal Woundcare Pvt. Ltd., a startup based in Bangalore, India. Some products developed within the scope of this thesis are in the process of being commercialized. With the translation of these advancements into the market, we envision that technologies will be available in the clinic to alleviate clinical challenges for improved patient care.

Separation technology is no exception. 2D nanomaterials possess numerous desirable properties such as large specific surface area, high aspect ratio, nanometre level thickness and more, which make them suitable for separation processes such as membrane separation and sorbent-based oil-water separation.   This thesis focuses on one such nanomaterial - hexagonal boron nitride (hBN, a 2D nanomaterial analogous to graphene), and the applications of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets in polymer nanocomposites for water remediation. The first part of the thesis will focus on developing polymer nanocomposite water filtration membranes to achieve dye rejection and fouling resistance. Our process involved integrating functionalized hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets into a polyvinylidene fluoride and polydopamine interpenetrating network membrane through the non-solvent-induced phase separation route. The resulting membranes demonstrate high pure water flux, effective dye rejection over multiple cycles of operation when tested with anionic and cationic dyes, and high resistance to fouling on testing with bovine serum albumin as the model foulant.   The second part of the thesis will focus on developing polymer nanocomposite foams incorporated with hBN nanosheets for oil-water separation. Separation of oil from oil-contaminated water is pertinent for cleaning up oil spills, leaks, and untreated wastewater effluents from various industries as the oil can damage marine ecosystems and have far-reaching, long-lasting repercussions. Selective oil sorption from oil-contaminated water can be achieved using polymer foams as sorbents. Herein, we prepared flexible polyurethane (PU) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foams, which were infused with hBN nanosheets through a facile template leaching process to study the oil sorption performance of the foams across various model oils. The selective removal of oil from oil-water stratified mixtures using these foams was tested under static and agitated conditions. These foams could retain their sorption capacity over multiple study cycles while maintaining their structural integrity. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the potential of hexagonal boron nitride nanomaterials and their polymer nanocomposites in enhancing the current polymer-based membrane and foam architectures for water remediation applications.

As an electric current reverse its direction across a   crack, massive current crowding occurs at the crack tip, thereby   generating a non-uniform temperature field sourcing away from the crack   tip, and considerable electromagnetic forces are generated on the crack   faces that open the crack in Mode I. Recent studies have shown that a   pre-existing crack in a conductor can propagate due to the tensile   stresses generated near the crack tip as well as heal due to   simultaneous presence of compressive stresses upon application of an   electric current pulse of high density. The crack propagation due to   electric current is a structural integrity concern in applications where the current densities of the order of 108 A/m2 often pass through the material (such as railguns, Tokomak fusion reactors, microelectronics, etc.,). Moreover, these applications also experience external magnetic field and mechanical load in addition to pure electromagnetic loading, which may further lead to deterioration and catastrophic failure of the component. On the contrary, the electric current-induced crack healing can aid in extending the life of the in-service components with surface and subsurface cracks.    Interestingly, a connection between the two effects namely, crack   propagation and crack healing caused by a single stimulus (i.e., e= lectric current) is not yet established. Hence, the main aim of this work was to understand the interconnection between crack propagation and healing caused by the passage of electric current in a conductor comprising a crack and derive the conditions leading to crack   propagation and crack healing. Further, in this process, the study   addressed the gaps in the literature concerning to the effect of   external fields on the fracture behavior of thin metallic conductors.   Additionally, the study explored the possibility of complete solid-state crack healing in a metallic conductor, owing to the high-temperature field and the compressive stresses near the crack tip, with precise control of the process parameters which has not been studied before.    Accordingly, the following objectives were examined in this study:     To understand the attributes leading to crack propagation and crack   healing in a pre-cracked metallic conductor due to the passage of an   electric current pulse.   To understand the influence of external magnetic field on fracture   behavior of pre-cracked current carrying thin metallic conductor.   To expand the knowledge of crack deflection to develop an application towards toolless machining of thin metallic conductors by application of combined electromagnetic and mechanical loading.   To develop a comprehensive understanding of electric current-induced   crack closure and material healing in pre-cracked metallic conductors.   Additionally, to target solid-state bonding of the crack faces and to   achieve required process control for complete crack healing of a   material.   To understand the effectiveness of crack healing in terms of the   mechanical performance of the healed metallic conductors by performing   various mechanical tests.    Initially, a conducting plate with an edge crack was investigated under   the influence of electric current using the finite element analysis (FEA) to understand the variation of the distribution of the tensile and the compressive stresses near the crack tip in a thin metallic conductor with the electropulsing and sample parameters. The FEA predictions revealed that crack propagation might be possible in a relatively high conductive material (e.g., Al, Cu), having a longer pre-existing crack, when the electric current of shorter pulse width is passed through the conductor. Similarly, crack healing might be possible when an electric current of sufficiently larger pulse width is passed through a short crack containing conductor with a relatively high electrical resistivity. Hence, to validate these findings, the crack propagation and healing were studied in pure Al (a high conductivity metal) and austenitic stainless steel SS316 (a low conductivity alloy), respectively.    In the first part of the work, the effect of a uniform external magnetic field on the fracture behavior of 11 μm thick pre-notched Al foil carrying current was explored. Experiments were conducted by subjecting Al foil to a series of electric current pulses in the presence of an external magnetic field up to 1 T. A sharp crack propagation was observed, and the critical current density required to initiate crack propagation decreased linearly with the external magnetic field.  Further, FEA was performed to gain insights into the interactions of the self-induced and the external magnetic fields and in turn their effect on the electromagnetic stress acting near the crack tip. An expression for the stress intensity factor generated due to the electromagnetic loading in the presence of an external magnetic field was established.  Furthermore, the transient stress intensity  factor, KIE,t, calculated  for the critical combination of applied  nominal current density and  external magnetic field demonstrated a  reasonable match with the plane  stress fracture toughness, KIC,  confirming the classic fracture  condition of critical KIE,t ≥ KIC for  lower levels of external magnetic  fields (Bext &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;(&gt;&lt;(&gt;«)&gt;&lt;(&gt;= «)&gt;)&gt; 0.4 T) and for smaller crack lengths (a/W &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;(&gt;&lt;(&gt;«)&gt;&lt;(&gt;«)&gt;)&gt;  0.55), where a and W are the crack length and width of  the conductor,  respectively. Interestingly, the crack initiated at KIE=, t &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;(&gt;&lt;(&gt;«)&gt;&lt;(&gt;«)&gt;)&gt; KIC in  case of higher external magnetic fields and longer crack lengths. This was consistent with the occurrence of undulations near the crack faces induced due to local buckling. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of local buckling on the stress state and mode mixity near the crack was developed and the underlying reasons for the crack initiation below KIC were discussed.    Additionally, a detailed microstructural examination of the fracture   surface of the thicker Al foils (25 μm and 100 μm) revealed c= onsiderable thinning before the final fracture under pure electromagnetic and in combination with mechanical loading, indicating plane stress fracture.  Further, the foil fractured by the application of combined electromagnetic and mechanical loading revealed a dominant transgranular fracture. After developing an understanding of the interactions of the pure electromagnetic loading with the external mechanical loading, a fully automated toolless machining setup was designed and fabricated to machine thin metallic conductors by controlling the crack propagation direction (i.e., the angle of crack deflection, θ, and the length of crack propagation, Δa). The setup enabled the simultaneous application of electric current pulses and far-field mechanical loading at various angles ranging from -60˚ to 60˚ with respect to normal of the crack faces. A wavy crack propagation resembling a sinusoidal pattern was demonstrated in 25 μm thick Al foil because of the in-plane mixed mode fracture caused by the interplay between the electromagnetic and mechanical loading. FEA provided further insights into controlling the crack propagation process by estimation of the Mode I and Mode II stress intensity factors and the associated crack deflection angle.  Interestingly, the observed crack deflection angles showed a decent match with the estimated crack deflection angle (based on LEFM).  Finally, the effect of the relative fraction of the electromagnetic and the mechanical loading on the machining resolution was discussed.    Further, the study expanded the understanding of crack healing upon   passage of an electric current pulse. The electropulsing parameters were optimized to create diffusion bonding conditions (i.e., significant compressive stresses and appropriate temperature) near the crack faces using FEA. The conjugate experiments performed on SS 316 revealed a complete healing of a through-thickness fatigue crack due to   high-density electropulsing. A detailed microstructural analysis of the   healed region revealed significant interface boundary migration and   formation of cell structure, thus signifying diffusion or solid-state   bonding as the primary bonding mechanism. In addition to elucidating the role of the thermal effects of electric current on the healing process, the study also thoroughly discussed the influence of athermal effects, such as electroplasticity and electromigration. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the healing in terms of mechanical performance was   explored by performing uniaxial tension, fatigue, and nanoindentation   tests. The commendable mechanical properties of the healed samples, especially after solution annealing were observed owing to the excellent healing of the crack faces achieved in the study.    Overall, the developed understanding in this work sheds light on the   attributes leading to crack propagation and healing caused by electric   current by a systematic numerical and experimental coupled approach.

Thomas Mikolajick  NaMLab gGmbH and  Chair of Nanoelectronics; TU Dresden   When?  6th March, 2024 (Wednesday), 04.00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore   Abstract  More than ever modern electronic systems require semiconductor memories [1]. The rapidly increasing use of artificial intelligence in electronic systems is a major driver to this trend [2]. At the same time, new physical storage mechanisms like ferroelectric polarization, magnetoresistance, phase change, and various resistive switching effects are receiving increasing attention due to the facts that traditional charge-based memory devices are facing serious scaling limits and become harder to integrate into modern high-performance CMOS processes that use high-k metal gate technology as well as non-planar device geometries [1]. Compare to the other mentioned options, ferroelectric polarization has two important unique selling points. First, the switching is field driven and, therefore, the energy required for writing is the lowest of all options that offer nonvolatility. Second, there are three fundamentally different options for the readout. Direct sensing of the switched charge in a ferroelectric capacitor (DRAM like sensing), coupling of the polarization to the gate of a field effect transistor (Flash like sensing) and modulation of the resistance of a tunnel junction (resistive switching like sensing) offering a high flexibility to taylor devices towards the application requirements while still using the same physical mechanism and material system. Well-known ferroelectric materials like lead zirconium titanate or strontium bismuth tantalate etc. are difficult to integrate into state-of-the-art electronic fabrication processes. About 15 years ago ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide was discovered and first published 12 years ago [3]. With this innovation, all of a sudden, a CMOS compatible ferroelectric material became available.  Moreover, the recent discovery of ferroelectricity in AlScN [5] added a valuable option for compound semiconductor technologies based on GaN.   The talk will first explain the approach to realize ferroelectric hafnium oxide based materials of high quality including recent advances. Based on this the status of integrating such materials into devices utilizing the three different readout mechanisms described above will be introduced and discussed. Finally, applications beyond the pure memory operation will be illustrated. An outlook towards future developments will conclude the talk.   References:  [1] T. Schenk, M. Pešić, S. Slesazeck, U.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Abhishek Sarmah   McMaster University, Canada   When?  5th April, 2024 (Tuesday), 10.30 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore   Abstract  Damage evolution in AA7075 is complex due to the presence of different second phase particles in the microstructure. Different particle stoichiometries, each with unique mechanical properties and geometrical features, can have a cumulative effect on damage with increasing applied loading.   A study of damage in such microstructures necessitates a hierarchical multiscale approach that effectively combines numerical modelling at different length scales with complementary experiments. Microscale finite element (FE) models created from actual microstructures using electron micrographs and tomography data, can capture real particle distribution along with key geometrical features of each particle stoichiometries. Additionally, nanoscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide important cohesive properties describing interphases of various particles embedded in the matrix. Complementary experiments, such as in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray computed tomography (XCT) tensile tests etc.,  yield important data necessary for both FE model calibration and validation.   Particle fracture marginally dominates particle decohesion. At low plastic strains, void nucleation is initiated by decohesion and fracture of coarse Fe-rich particles, which facilitate formation of localized deformation bands. At large plastic strains, elevated stresses within the localized bands facilitate decohesion and fracture of more resistant η and θ precipitates. The effect of particle morphology and size is significant. Void coalescence occurs along deformation bands driven by higher stresses due to accumulated plastic strain within the bands, in a process known as void sheeting.   About the Speaker  Abhishek Sarmah got his bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tezpur University,  master’s degree in Materials Science and Engineering from IIT Gandhinagar and PhD from McMaster University.

He was the 2021 recipient of The G.E. Orovas Memorial Scholarship. He has published his work in 6 international journals , 2 conferences and 1 book chapter.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Multifunctional hydrogels with injectable, self-healing, and shape-morphing capabilities for biomedical applications   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Kaushik Chatterjee   When?  08th April, 2024 (Monday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  In recent years, there has been a notable surge in interest surrounding implantable biomaterials due to their potential applications in treating physical defects and traumas. Hydrogels have garnered growing attention among implantable biomaterials due to their favorable rheological properties and adjustable structures. However, conventional hydrogel materials are prone to mechanical failures and cause patient discomfort during routine operations, which are significant challenges. This thesis presents novel findings on the development of hydrogels for biomedical applications that are endowed with superior attributes such as injectability, self-healing, and the ability to process by three-dimensional (3D) printing.   To address these shortcomings, hydrogels endowed with injectability and self-healing capabilities, enabling them to recover their structural integrity, offer numerous advantages such as vehicles for controlled, sustained, and localized delivery in a minimally invasive manner for biomedical applications. The first part of this thesis focuses on the development of a novel generation of multifunctional polysaccharide-based injectable hydrogels through rational engineering with a prolonged lifespan due to their robust self-healing nature, thus tremendously enhancing their potential for clinical translation. These hydrogels are endowed with injectability and self-healing capabilities, enabling them to recover their structural integrity and offer numerous advantages over conventional hydrogels for biomedical applications, such as vehicles for controlled, sustained, and localized delivery in a minimally invasive manner. Furthermore, a generalized easy approach for surface modification of nanomaterials with a bioligand was developed to prepare a degradable polysaccharide-based injectable hydrogel that is shown to be multifunctional, including self-healing, flexible, and antibacterial properties for biomedical applications.   Another significant limitation in the current clinical scenario is the inability to fabricate complex, patient-specific geometries and tissue architectures that will find potential applications in ex vivo tissue models, patient-specific implants and tissue scaffolds, deployable devices, soft robotics, and drug delivery systems. Manufacturing of such structures necessitates the development of techniques offering precise spatial control with excellent resolution, and advanced manufacturing in the form of three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) printing offers such advantages, along with the added possibility of encapsulating biological agents (cells, peptides, drugs, etc.). The second part of the thesis presents work on a novel 4D (bio)printing approach that employs biocompatible and versatile biomaterial ink design to encode an innovative shape-morphing strategy that can facilitate the development of smart solutions for challenging biomedical challenges. Finally, the potential applications of additively manufactured hydrogel structures for healthcare are now being extended to new frontiers, such as human-machine interfaces, wearable medical devices, soft robotics, biosensors, and engineered living systems. To this end, a 3D printable hydrogels endowed with conducting and anti-freezing capabilities were developed, which successfully retained other functionalities and cytocompatibility. These reversible shape deformation in 3D printed constructs in this system, which offers possibilities for use in advanced biomedical applications under extreme temperature conditions.   Taken together, the work presented in this thesis is critically important for developing tuneable, multifunctional, affordable, self-healing, and injectable hydrogel systems and 4D printable ink and techniques that are expected to find applications in healthcare, biosensors, deployable devices, and soft robotics for clinical translation.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  High-Throughput Bending Tests for Investigating Creep Behavior Affected by  Structural and Microstructural Inhomogeneities   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Praveen Kumar (Prof. Vikram Jayaram - Co-Supervisor)   When?  17th April, 2024 (Wednesday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  Online   Abstract  The bending of cantilevers is an alternate technique for the extraction  of power-law creep parameters of materials. It has been shown earlier  that in homogeneous systems showing tension-compression symmetry,  digital image correlation (DIC) can provide a high-throughput evaluation  of creep parameters.  Multiple stress-strain rate pairs could be  obtained from a single test in a geometry that can accommodate small  samples and simple fixturing. The present thesis attempts to extend the  usefulness of this technique to more complex systems which display large  or small-scale microstructural gradients and tension-compression  asymmetry.   In the first example, bending integrated with digital image correlation  (DIC) and finite element analysis (FEA) demonstrates that creep  deformation in a material primarily occurs in approximately 30% of the  cantilever volume near the fixed end, especially when the power-law  exponent ranges from 6 to 7. As an approach to minimize the amount of  material required for testing, the concept of fabricating composite  cantilevers has been proposed and validated in this study. The composite  cantilever consists of an ‘active’ creeping portion of T22 boiler steel  (2.25Cr-1Mo) and an additively extended ‘passive’ non-creeping portion  of IN-718. The reduction process involved varying the length of the T22  section, a, while keeping the total sample length, L, constant. The DIC  measurements conducted at 600 °C to assess the creep behavior revealed  that non-linear analytical expressions for cantilevers could aptly  predict the monolithic constitutive steady-state creep laws from the  composite cantilever behavior if measurements are made at a critical  distance away from the interface. FEA indicates that accurate stress  estimations enable predicting monolithic behavior using composite samp= les with smaller “a/L” ratios (e.g., 5%) also, with regions closer to the interface. Using such an approach, the creep degradation  in boiler steel that has been in service for ~ 240,000 h is ascertained  using composite cantilevers with a small volume of “active” material.  The implications of the observations for estimating the residual life of  in-service high-temperature components are discussed.   The second example comes from a study of the influence of  microstructurally textured regions (MTRs) in a rolled commercial  Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Such macroscopic inhomogeneities lead to long-range  strain localisation owing to the non-uniform deformation. The well-known=  tension-compression asymmetry in titanium during the c+a dislocation glide is captured using the small-scale bending of samples at  room temperature. The presence of extended \\left[10\\bar{1}0\\right] MTRs  along the rolling direction (RD) leads to a shift in the neutral axis  towards the other half of the cantilever. Thus, the anisotropy and  asymmetry in creep are readily brought out uniquely in a single  experiment via the geometry of bending creep. In addition,  microstructure correlations have been made using polarized light  microscopy (PLM) as a high throughput method to correlate the presence  of such MTRs with the creep behaviour at room temperature.   Overall, these experiments serve as a foundation for the study of creep  in complex engineering material systems, such as weldments, composites,  hybrid joints, etc. and residual life assessment and structural health  monitoring.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Advancements in E-Waste Management: Encapsulation, Sensing, and Biodegradable Packaging for Environmental Sustainability   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Praveen Ramamurthy   When?  22th April, 2024 (Monday), 11:30 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Monitoring pollution levels and extent is crucial for preserving our environment’s sustainability. Advances in the technology sector, facilitated by new materials and methods, have significantly improved. Nonetheless, these advancements have resulted in an increase in electronic waste (e-waste), posing a significant environmental risk. If not properly managed, the disposal of e-waste can lead to the release of harmful metals and organic substances into soil and water, endangering ecosystems. This thesis delineates the various sources of e-waste and the current state of remediation, focusing on encapsulation, sensing, and the development of biodegradable alternatives. It specifically addresses two primary sources of electronic waste: lead-perovskite solar cells and plastic substrates used in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) applications and electronic substrates.   The renewable energy sector’s extensive use of solar cells, particularly perovskites, has propelled forward the search for new materials. Lead-containing perovskite solar cells have shown to increase photovoltaic power conversion efficiency significantly. Despite the exploration of lead-free alternatives, current research suggests that the most efficient and dependable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilize lead salts, which are harmful to both human health and the environment. This research integrates encapsulation modifications and sensing technologies to address lead leaching from perovskite solar cells effectively. Encapsulation involves the physical containment of a device within a polymer film that has functional groups capable of binding with lead ions, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of Surlyn beyond its traditional use in photovoltaic packaging. This method leverages the affinity of lead for amine-functionalized molecules for both sensing and encapsulation purposes. A metal-organic framework, ZIF-67, coated over Surlyn, demonstrated a remarkable reduction in lead leakage. Appropriately functionalized ZIF, was used to detect lead from degraded perovskite solar cells, with a detection limit of 60 ppb. This sensor exhibited remarkable sensitivity in detecting lead ions in water samples, proving its efficacy in practical applications.   Another focal point of this thesis is the development of flexible cellulose films and composites for packaging, electronic substrates for PCBs, and flexible devices. Cellulose extracted from sugarcane bagasse was crosslinked to create a biodegradable film with a water vapor transmission rate of 350 g/m²/day, suitable for both packaging and device substrates. Additionally, an innovative approach involved replacing conventional plastic PCB substrates with those incorporating biodegradable components. Epoxy-silane functionalized microcrystalline cellulose (SMC) composites were developed, exhibiting a dielectric constant ranging from 10 to 14 across frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz while maintaining adequate mechanical properties.

These situations often demand patient-specific treatments, as standard implants may not deliver expected functional outcomes. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a promising solution by enabling the fabrication of near-net shape parts. However, the properties of AM-fabricated alloys differ significantly from conventionally processed ones due to inherent high cooling rates and thermal gradients during AM, thus altering the microstructural features.   In this thesis, two different Ti alloys, namely Ti-6Al-4V ELI (α+β) and Ti-35Nb-5Ta-7Zr (β) were investigated for biomedical applications, particularly for load-bearing orthopedic implants. The first part of the thesis is focused on applying cyclic heat treatment to modify the microstructure of bone plates (prepared by selective laser melting, SLM) from acicular martensite to bimodal, significantly enhancing biomechanical performance, especially in bending. A comparison between additively manufactured, heat-treated (HT), and wrought (WR) Ti-6Al-4V ELI (Ti64) has been brought out, considering microstructural (including texture), mechanical, electrochemical, and biological aspects. The study revealed comparable biomechanical performance between additively manufactured materials after heat treatment and wrought materials. Subsequent fracture toughness evaluation indicated poorer values for AM samples, showing strong anisotropy in crack initiation along the build direction. However, heat treatment effectively improved fracture toughness in both orientations. It has been observed that hard orientations impede crack initiation, while twinning activity aids in blunting crack tips and limiting propagation. Tribocorrosion measurements revealed much more wear volume loss due to the synergistic effect of wear and corrosion. The mechanism of tribocorrosion varied depending on the testing conditions; wear was dominant under open circuit potential (OCP) conditions, whereas wear-induced corrosion prevailed under Potentiostatic conditions. The performance of HT samples was significantly improved compared to wrought Ti64, as reported in the literature.   Building on these findings, patient-specific implants, biomechanically improved post AM through heat treatment, were evaluated in human subjects with upper limb complications, resulting in safe and effective treatment for malunions and deformities, with reduced surgical time. This constitutes the second part of the thesis.   The last part is focused on developing an alloy with the composition Ti-35Nb-5Ta-7Zr using directed energy deposition (DED) technique. Nearly dense components exhibited complete β phase stability, lower elastic modulus, strong crystallographic texture, high strength, good ductility, excellent corrosion resistance, and cytocompatibility.   Overall, the work presented in the thesis has important implications for development and translation of additively manufactured Ti alloys for orthopedic implants.  ","categories": [],

These treatments often suffer from limitations such as non-specific targeting, affecting both healthy and cancerous cells, low bioavailability, and the development of resistance by cancer cells, which reduces their effectiveness. Nano-drug delivery systems are revolutionizing lung cancer treatment. However, a major challenge is that only a small fraction of administered nanoparticles reach the target tumor site, with delivery rates as low as 0.7%. Smaller nanoparticles penetrate tumors more effectively but are quickly cleared from the body and have reduced drug-loading capacities. Conversely, larger nanoparticles can carry more drugs but may struggle to penetrate deeply into tumors. Overcoming these issues requires a unique combination of strategies. Additionally, most nanoparticles are attacked by the immune system, necessitating methods to evade immune detection.   Addressing the limitations and gaps of current drug delivery methods, this study aims to design a multistage delivery system that mimics red blood cells (RBCs) for site-specific drug delivery. This system integrates a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles encapsulated within a thermoresponsive nanogel to achieve photothermal therapy (PTT), targeted chemotherapy, and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Initially, various strategies were employed to prepare a robust and multifunctional CuS nanoparticle characterized by small size, functionalization capability, and optimal photothermal efficiency. This process involved exploring various methods and materials, which were evaluated for their material properties, phototheranostic capabilities, and anticancer properties. Ultimately, a particle prepared using Mucin was finalized and further evaluated for its in vivo photoacoustic imaging capability.   Next, to facilitate the on-demand release of CuS and the drug, a NIPAM-based nanogel was designed to degrade at elevated temperatures, allowing for targeted drug release. The nanogel was engineered to release its components only in response to thermal stimuli, with a transition temperature above body temperature. Additionally, the potential of coating this loaded nanogel with an RBC membrane to mimic natural RBCs was investigated, thereby avoiding immune responses and opsonization.   The nanoparticles underwent extensive in vitro assays and spheroid studies. The developed system was ultimately tested on lung tumor-bearing mouse models to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrated a significant impact of the multistage and multimodal system on tumor regression compared to individual components, with no observed toxicity upon application.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Effect of Microstructural Evolution on the Electrochemical Degradation Behaviour of Electrodeposited Tin-Based Coatings   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Chandan Srivastava   When?  10th June, 2024 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Electroplated Sn has been used as a protective coating against corrosion, as an anode material for rechargeable Li-ion battery, decorative finishes, and in electronic packaging. The application of electrodeposited Sn is limited by its electrochemical degradation which reduces reliability and increases the operating cost. In the present work, the corrosion behavior of electrodeposited Sn-based coatings (Sn-Ni, Sn-Zn, and Sn-Bi) has been studied by examining the corrosion products, spatial distribution of phase, solute clustering/partitioning within the matrix, micro-texture, and coating strain. Key observations made in the current work are: (i) optimum incorporation of Ni in Sn coating (6 wt% Ni) produced a highly corrosion-resistant Sn-Ni coating with Ni3Sn4 intermetallic occupying the grain boundaries, low energy (100) orientated Sn matrix, highest fraction of low energy (031) [01̅3] and (01̅1) [011] twin boundaries and lower matrix strain. Contrary, higher Ni addition (13 wt% Ni) degraded the corrosion resistance of the Sn-Ni coating, due to galvanic coupling between the anodic Sn-rich matrix and cathodic intermetallic phase (Ni3Sn4), and evolution of high energy texture characterized by a high fraction of high energy high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), high matrix strain, and low fraction of low energy twin boundaries, (ii) a non-monotonic variation in the corrosion rate of the Sn-Bi coatings with Bi addition (0-17 wt% Bi) was noted. A highly corrosion-resistant Sn-Bi coating was produced at an optimum Bi incorporation (14 wt% Bi). Sn clusters in Bi-rich grains strained the Bi grains, thus lowering its effective passiveness and reducing the extent of micro-galvanic coupling between Sn-rich (anodic) and Bi-rich (cathodic) grains. The increase in the corrosion resistance for optimum Bi content was also due to the evolution of surface texture (of the matrix Sn phase) corresponding to low energy (101) orientation and highest fraction of low-energy CSL boundaries, (iii) in Sn-14wt%Bi, coatings electrodeposited at different cathodic current densities (5, 12, 25, and 40 mA/cm2), highest corrosion resistance was observed for the coating electrodeposited at the 25 mA/cm2 current density. This was due to low-energy (301) surface texture, evolution of the Sn-1.2at% Bi solid solution phase, and formation of SnO2 oxide passive layer. Lowest corrosion resistance observed for 40 mA/cm2 deposited coating was due to high energy (110) surface texture, formation of Bi-enriched clusters in Sn matrix, and an unstable passive layer consisting of SnO and Sn(OH)2 oxides, (iv) corrosion resistance of Sn-Zn coatings decreased at lower quantities of Zn addition (up to 10 wt%) but increased substantially at higher Zn contents (20-25 wt% Zn). At higher Zn additions, the enhanced corrosion resistance was due to a higher fraction of low energy coincidence site lattice boundaries (CSLs), and preferred low-energy (100) surface texture. On the other hand, a higher corrosion rate for lower Zn addition stemmed from a highly strained matrix and a relatively higher fraction of high-energy, HAGBs, (v) a non-monotonic variation in the corrosion rate of the Sn-23wt% coating with increasing deposition current (7, 12, 17, and 22 mA/cm2) was noticed. The coating deposited at 12 mA/cm2 exhibited the highest corrosion resistance due to relatively lower energy surface texture, higher fraction of lower energy grain boundaries, lesser coating strain, and evolution of protective oxide film with stabler oxides (ZnO and SnO2). Higher energy (110) surface grain orientation, unstable b-Sn matrix due to embedded Zn-enriched clusters, and weak passive layer consisting of Zn0 led to the lowest corrosion resistance for coating electrodeposited at 17 mA/cm2.

To meet these objectives, Sonera has developed novel surface acoustic wave (SAW) based delay-line sensors that leverage the coupling between SAW and spin waves in a synthetic multiferroic heterostructure to create an extremely efficient method for energy transduction. In this sensing modality, termed acoustically-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ADFMR), a thin magnetic film strip is deposited between two pairs of lithographically patterned interdigital transducers, and is excited into resonance through elastic interactions with the travelling SAW. Any small external magnetic field will shift the magnetic film out of resonance, and alter the transmission characteristics of the SAW, allowing for very high sensitivity. In this talk, I will examine the design considerations of the magnetoelectric layer for ADFMR based magnetometry, with particular emphasis on the growth and optimization of FeGaB based magnetostrictive thin films on yz-cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrates. I will conclude with examples of how the design and properties of the magnetoelectric layer impact the ADFMR device characteristics such as rf power absorption, sensitivity and the sensor’s limit of detection.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Engineering Interpenetrating Polymeric Network (IPN) Membranes for Effective Water Remediation   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Suryasarathi Bose   When?  8th July, 2024 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Water is fundamental to human life, sustaining ecosystems, supporting livelihoods, and underpinning human well-being. Despite its importance, water scarcity is a growing global issue due to population growth, economic expansion, and climate change, which strain freshwater resources and exacerbate disparities in access. This imbalance between water availability and demand threatens ecosystems and socio-economic stability. International risk assessments since 2015 have highlighted water scarcity as a major concern. The unequal global distribution and overuse of freshwater are expected to worsen the situation, with the World Economic Forum projecting that by 2050, around two-thirds of the global population will live in areas facing water stress. Therefore, purifying existing water resources is crucial. Primarily driven by population growth, intensified agricultural demands, and rapid industrial expansion, it has been statistically demonstrated that global water consumption has increased manifold since the 1950s. In this scenario, researchers have resorted to Membrane technology, which is considered cost-effective, efficient on a vast scale, environmentally safe, and socially acceptable. An ideal membrane should exhibit high permeability, selectivity, and effectiveness over a wide range of contaminants, be vested with high mechanical stability, and resist fouling.   However conventional membranes often fall short and are unable to meet stringent water standards owing to issues such as fouling and scaling, which eventually leads to membrane failure. A definitive solution to this issue remains elusive. This thesis is motivated by the challenges and seeks to engineer porous membranes via the application of cutting-edge materials like Interpenetrating Polymeric Networks (IPNs). It can enhance the chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability of polymeric materials, prolonging the system’s lifespan and enabling it to be reused and recycled without sacrificing its effectiveness in removing pollutants. Moreover, IPNs are highly feasible and tailorable, allowing for the use of non-toxic chemicals and solvents, owing to their design flexibility in terms of selecting suitable monomers during the design process for targeted pollutant removal. Furthermore, by modifying the structure of the interpenetrating polymer, it becomes possible to customize the membrane’s pore size and enhance its resistance to fouling and separation capabilities.   This thesis focuses on the design and optimization of polymeric membranes for effective and efficient water remediation. At the onset, the thesis begins primarily with exploring the fundamentals of polymeric membranes and the various methods used for fabricating and modifying them to enhance separation efficiency and prevent fouling, as documented in the literature. It examines the underlying mechanisms that contribute to separation efficiency and assist in the development of anti-fouling properties. In doing so, the thesis delves into the intricacies of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) and various functional nanomaterials, highlighting their significance in engineering a portfolio of membranes with gradually reducing pore size and increasing surface charge. Furthermore, the latter half of the thesis emphasizes the importance of ensuring sustainability in membrane technologies by fabricating recyclable and high-performing membranes via installing in-situ “exchangeable bonds” (or Covalent Adaptable Networks, CANs) directly at the outset of the fabrication process. The existence of exchangeable bonds facilitated the integration of closed-loop circularity within the membranes, thereby creating a route for the reutilization of fouled membranes. The designed membranes can revolutionize membrane technology by providing straightforward regeneration techniques and promoting a transition towards circular approaches in product life cycles, significantly improving membrane waste management.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Fully-printed field-effect transistors and circuits from two-dimensional semiconductors: novel approaches to mitigate large inter-flake resistance in solution-processed devices   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Subho Dasgupta   When?  12th July, 2024 (Friday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  The escalating demand for wearables and large-area electronics has underscored the critical necessity for pioneering semiconducting materials. While organic semiconductors offer flexibility and processability at lower temperatures, their performance and air stability are typically limited. In contrast, inorganic two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit properties conducive to the next generation large-area and flexible devices, including appropriate band gaps, intrinsic flexibility, and the availability of both n-type and p-type semiconductors. Various techniques exist for the large-scale synthesis of 2D materials, with chemical and physical vapor deposition imposing substrate limitations, due to high process temperatures required. Conversely, solution-based techniques provide substrate flexibility with the process temperature being generally low. When integrated with printing, solution-based techniques can allow roll-to-roll processing of electronic devices through which we can even realize disposable electronics.   With the above motivation, there are several reports on solution processed transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD, such as MoS2, WS2 etc.) transistors. However, the performance falls short because of the presence of inter-flake resistance between the flakes. The inter-flake junction is an integral part of thin films deposited from solution-processed two-dimensional materials. It is characterized by very poor electronic transport, which is not tunable electrostatically. This resistance ends up determining the device properties rather than the intrinsic properties of the semiconducting material itself.   In this regard, this dissertation work addresses this bottleneck by presenting methods to achieve high-performance 2D transistors and circuits. The first chapter introduces an innovative device geometry that can convert inter-flake transport to predominantly intra-flake, utilizing a near-vertical device architecture. Hence, instead of having charge transport along the printed semiconductor film laterally, we observe nearvertical carrier transport through the semiconductor film, drastically reducing the number of junctions, which makes the device performance close to that of the single-flake device. Inkjet-printed n-type MoS2 transistors, utilizing this geometry, achieve a high electron current density of 300 μA.μm-1 and an On-Off ratio of 106. Interestingly, we have also observed gate tunable capacitance modulation, which results in subthermionic transport and a low subthreshold swing of 7.5 mV.decade-1. In the second chapter, exploiting the predominant intra-flake transport, we fabricate logic circuits from printed 2D transistors. Initially, unipolar depletion-mode inverters are shown with a maximum gain of 31 and dynamic power consumption below 15 nW. Next, we also demonstrate NOR, AND, NAND, and OR gates operating at 1 kHz. Moreover, we show the possibility of doping and contact resistance modulation in the printed devices, which are otherwise not conceivable in the presence of inter-flake resistance limited devices.   In the third chapter, by capitalizing on the novel device architecture, we fabricate complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. The first target was to realize p-type 2D transistors, for which we utilized mono elemental Te as the semiconductor material. Here, we have achieved a high current density of 100 μA.μm-1, maintaining an On-Off ratio of 105. These p-type transistors, along with n-type MoS2 transistors, are then used to fabricate CMOS transistors. We could show a maximum gain of 11 at a mere supply voltage of 1.5 V. Also, it is shown to respond rail-to-rail at an AC input frequency of 1 kHz.   In the fourth and last chapter, we exploit the 1T metallic and 2H semiconducting polymorph of MoS2 to show high-performance devices in a lateral geometry itself. By inducing a metallic nature in the semiconducting flakes, we demonstrate it is possible to outdo the inter-flake resistance in a printed film when most of the flakes are metallic in nature, where the transport is controlled by the semiconducting flakes placed in between. Fascinatingly, we could show devices that can be fabricated at room temperature without needing surface treatment. In this chapter, we show fully-printed thin fil,m transistors (TFTs) on a paper substrate utilizing screen-printed 2D Mxene, Ti3C2 as the metal electrodes, and inkjet printed MoS2 as the semiconductor material. This work demonstrates that it is possible to fabricate fully-printed high performance electronics with 2D materials.  ","categories": [],

Developing scaffolds that can accurately mimic the complex physiology of human tissues is crucial. Among the various fabrication methods, 3D bioprinting has emerged as a revolutionary technique capable of creating intricate structures by precisely depositing cells within a matrix of biomaterials. Various biomaterials such as gelatin, alginate, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and agarose have been utilized to fabricate bioinks owing to their properties that support tissue growth and organization. However, these materials often fail to meet the diverse mechanical and biophysical requirements of different tissues, and there is a growing need for polymers that offer additional biomedically beneficial properties, such as inherent anti-biofouling capabilities. Thus highlighting the necessity for further exploration of suitable biomaterials. In addressing these challenges, our study explores mucin as a bioink material. Mucin, a glycoprotein found abundantly in mucus that lines mucosal surfaces, possesses unique hydrogel properties. Beyond its role in hydration, lubrication, and forming protective barriers, mucin exhibits complex biochemical structures that facilitate chemical modifications. Despite these advantages, mucins are relatively underexplored in the field of 3D bioprinting.   In our research, we synthesized a mucin-based bioink and evaluated its rheological behavior, printability, and compatibility with cells. By modifying mucin with methacrylic anhydride (MA), we synthesized a photocrosslinkable derivative methecrylated mucin (MuMA). Using lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) as a visible light (405 nm) photoinitiator, we ensured cell safety compared to UV-induced crosslinking methods used in other bioinks. This approach highlights mucin’s versatility and potential as a bioink material, offering a pathway to develop advanced tissue engineering constructs that meet the diverse needs of biomedical applications.   In our initial work, to create a bioink with optimum viscosity, we combined MuMA with bare mucin. The inherent inter- and intra-molecular interactions facilitated the physical crosslinking between the MuMA and mucin. The bioink demonstrates favorable rheological, gelation, and structural properties when crosslinked. It exhibits shear thinning behavior, ensuring cell safety during printing, while its EGF-like domains, rich in cysteine, facilitate the growth, migration, and differentiation of fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. The printed scaffolds feature optimal swelling and degradation properties, with a pore size of &lt;100 µm, promoting the migration and proliferation of NIH3T3 cells. Varying the crosslinking time provides insights into the properties of the 3D-printed scaffolds. An increase in cell numbers after 21 days indicates the matrix’s cell-supportive nature. Our findings demonstrate that mucin-based bioink promises a significant advancement toward expanding the repertoire of bioinks available for 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering.   To improve the properties of the bioink further, we have combined hyaluronic acid (HA) and MuMA to be used for lung tissue engineering. HA, a crucial extracellular matrix component, is mucoadhesive and enhances ink viscosity and printability. Rheological tests reveal shear-thinning behavior, aiding cell protection during printing and improved MuMA bioink viscosity by adding HA. The printed structures exhibited porous behavior conducive to nutrient transport and cell migration. After four weeks in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the scaffolds retain 70% of their mass, highlighting stability. Biocompatibility tests with lung epithelial cells (L-132) confirm cell attachment and growth, suggesting suitability for lung tissue engineering. In the following study, for cartilage tissue engineering, ionically crosslinkable alginate was incorporated into the MuMA bioink, forming a double crosslinked interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel bioink. Furthermore, HA, naturally occurring in cartilage and synovial fluid, was introduced to enhance scaffold characteristics. HA has been shown to improve cartilage lubrication, regulate inflammation, promote cell proliferation, and enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and regeneration, proving beneficial in cartilage tissue engineering. The study demonstrated that double crosslinked scaffolds made of MuMA, alginate, and HA exhibited compressive moduli similar to native cartilage, contrasting with single crosslinked counterparts. Degradation profile, water uptake, and porosity were also influenced by double crosslinking, ensuring scaffold durability and stability to support chondrocytes. Biocompatibility tests with C28/I2 cells and collagen type II profiling suggest the chondrogenesis and cell-supportive nature of the bioink. This study proves mucin to be a versatile material for tailored cartilage tissue engineering applications.   Our study concludes that mucin demonstrates promising potential as a bioink material that can be customized to suit specific applications, thus broadening the spectrum of available bioinks.

Cast SXs also exhibit a larger scale heterogeneity (&gt; 100 µm scale) associated with the microstructural evolution during directional solidification, where dendrites form and grow. Single dendrites as well as groups with a small number of parallel dendrites are slightly misoriented with respect to their neighborhood.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Thermal and Thermo-Mechanical Response of Additively Manufactured Hastelloy X   Faculty advisor(s):  Dr. Avadhani G S (Co-Supervisor - Prof. Satyam Suwas)   When?  25th July, 2024 (Thursday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the emerging technologies to manufacture near-net-shape engineering components layer-by-layer using a suitable heat source. The rapid adoption of AM in the field of aerospace owes to its ability to fabricate intricate parts in one step, sidestepping multiple processing stages, thereby reducing time, costs, and material waste. The blend of AM with nickel-based superalloys enables the production of intricate and durable components for the aerospace industry. The laser powder bed fusion processing (LPBF) of Hastelloy X serves as a prime example of this capability. While Hastelloy X has a long-standing history in aerospace applications, additive manufacturing represents a novel manufacturing technique. To ensure the industrial implementation of additively manufactured Hastelloy X, validating its viability through an extensive array of experimental investigations is imperative. Hastelloy X, known for its exceptional strength, oxidation resistance, and ability to withstand high temperatures, is particularly suitable for demanding applications in aerospace, especially in gas turbine engines. This thesis aims to investigate the microstructural and mechanical properties of LPBF-processed Hastelloy X to establish a correlation between different microstructural states and their corresponding mechanical behaviours at both room and elevated temperatures.   The initial stage of investigation comprises the microstructural characterization of as-built LPBF Hastelloy X. Additionally, the effect of heat treatment processes in incrementally rising temperatures on as-built microstructure, texture and room temperature tensile behaviour has been explored. Elongation was found in the range of 55 -75%, outperforming the wrought counterpart. The exceptional ductility of heat-treated specimens was attributed to combined factors, including the nearly full-density specimen (designed to have no cracks and minimal porosity), the stacking fault, the dislocation-mediated plasticity caused by the formation of microbands, and the twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effect.   Further, the elevated temperature tensile behaviour of stress-relieved (1050°C for 1 hour) Hastelloy X ranging from 500°C to 900°C has been investigated in detail. Moreover, the precipitation behaviour of M6C and M23C6 carbides in the above-mentioned temperature range has also been explored. The gradual decline in elongation was linked to the prevalence of intergranular fracture at higher temperatures, driven by the precipitation of carbides along the grain boundaries.   Additionally, the effect of prolonged thermal ageing on microstructural evolution and mechanical behaviour has been investigated. The stress-relieved Hastelloy X underwent prolonged thermal exposure at two distinct temperatures, namely 800°C and 950°C, each for a duration of 500 hours. This investigation aimed to elucidate the distribution and evolution of secondary phases within the material. A comprehensive microstructural analysis utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the development of M23C6 carbides alongside topologically close-packed (TCP) phases such as µ, R, and P. The room temperature tensile tests demonstrated higher yield strength and lower elongation of the 800°C, 500 h specimen compared to the 950°C, 500 h specimen, which was attributed to the precipitation strengthening provided by the µ phase.   Furthermore, creep and stress rupture behaviour of LPBF Hastelloy X have been investigated in the stress range of 75 – 150 MPa at 800°C, accounting for the microstructural anisotropy in two different directions in stress-relieved conditions. The investigation reveals that the dynamic precipitation of M6C, M23C6, σ and µ phases were found to be the origin of threshold stress. Considering the influence of threshold stress, the stress exponent values were estimated to be ~ 5.1 and ~ 4.5 for vertical and horizontal specimens, respectively, indicating dislocation climb as the underlying deformation mechanism. Notably, vertically oriented samples exhibit significantly superior creep and stress rupture properties compared to their horizontally oriented counterparts. This discrepancy is largely attributed to the columnar grain morphology observed in the vertical specimens, contrasting with the equiaxed morphology in the horizontal specimens.   Our study concludes that the LPBF Hastelloy X is a suitable candidate for replacing its wrought counterpart as both room and elevated temperature properties are comparable to its wrought counterpart.

Hydrogels have garnered growing attention among implantable biomaterials due to their favorable rheological properties and adjustable structures. However, conventional hydrogel materials are prone to mechanical failures and cause patient discomfort during routine operations, which are significant challenges. This thesis presents novel findings on the development of hydrogels for biomedical applications that are endowed with superior attributes such as injectability, self-healing, and the ability to process by three-dimensional (3D) printing. To address these shortcomings, hydrogels endowed with injectability and self-healing capabilities, enabling them to recover their structural integrity, offer numerous advantages such as vehicles for controlled, sustained, and localized delivery in a minimally invasive manner for biomedical applications. The first part of this thesis focuses on the development of a novel generation of multifunctional polysaccharide-based injectable hydrogels through rational engineering with a prolonged lifespan due to their robust self-healing nature, thus tremendously enhancing their potential for clinical translation. These hydrogels are endowed with injectability and self-healing capabilities, enabling them to recover their structural integrity and offer numerous advantages over conventional hydrogels for biomedical applications, such as vehicles for controlled, sustained, and localized delivery in a minimally invasive manner. Furthermore, a generalized easy approach for surface modification of nanomaterials with a bioligand was developed to prepare a degradable polysaccharide-based injectable hydrogel that is shown to be multifunctional, including self-healing, flexible, and antibacterial properties for biomedical applications. Another significant limitation in the current clinical scenario is the inability to fabricate complex, patient-specific geometries and tissue architectures that will find potential applications in ex vivo tissue models, patient-specific implants and tissue scaffolds, deployable devices, soft robotics, and drug delivery systems. Manufacturing of such structures necessitates the development of techniques offering precise spatial control with excellent resolution, and advanced manufacturing in the form of three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) printing offers such advantages, along with the added possibility of encapsulating biological agents (cells, peptides, drugs, etc.). The second part of the thesis presents work on a novel 4D (bio)printing approach that employs biocompatible and versatile biomaterial ink design to encode an innovative shape-morphing strategy that can facilitate the development of smart solutions for challenging biomedical challenges. Finally, the potential applications of additively manufactured hydrogel structures for healthcare are now being extended to new frontiers, such as human-machine interfaces, wearable medical devices, soft robotics, biosensors, and engineered living systems. To this end, a 3D printable hydrogels endowed with conducting and anti-freezing capabilities were developed, which successfully retained other functionalities and cytocompatibility. These reversible shape deformation in 3D printed constructs in this system, which offers possibilities for use in advanced biomedical applications under extreme temperature conditions. Taken together, the work presented in this thesis is critically important for developing tuneable, multifunctional, affordable, self-healing, and injectable hydrogel systems and 4D printable ink and techniques that are expected to find applications in healthcare, biosensors, deployable devices, and soft robotics for clinical translation.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Extraction of Bond Coat Mechanical Properties using High-Temperature Digital Image Correlation   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Vikram Jayaram  (Co-Supervisor - Prof. Praveen Kumar)   When?  8th August, 2024 (Thursday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Gas turbine engines used in aircraft or power generation widely use nickel-based superalloys in their hot sections such as combustion chambers, turbine blades, etc. These components in the hot section use thermal barrier coating (TBC) that reduces the temperature experienced by the substrate. A typical TBC is made of two layers: an oxidation-resistant bond coat such as diffusion aluminide or overlay MCrAlY coating, and a ceramic top coat, typically yittria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ). While oxidation and corrosion protection are the key functions of bond coats, their mechanical behaviour plays a key role in the spallation life of the TBC, particularly in thermal cycling scenarios like those experienced in aircraft engines. The cyclic thermal loading leads to undulation on the bond coat surface known as rumpling, which is driven by the thermo-mechanical properties of the bond coat.  However, limited information on these properties is available in the literature. Attempts to measure these properties have been inhibited by the limited thickness of these coatings. Studies to measure their properties using ingots cast with the same chemical composition are undermined by the fact that the microstructure of the bond coat is substantially different than that of the casting. In the present work, a small-scale testing method based on digital image correlation (DIC) has been developed to perform this study. This testing method is first va= lidated by obtaining the properties of commercially pure copper that showed excellent correlation. It was then used to characterize the thermo-mechanical properties of NiCoCrAlY (overlay type) of bond coats. Properties like CTE, Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and creep parameters were obtained. Young’s modulus and CTE of similar coatings available in the literature show a very good correlation, however, the creep parameters show significant differences. The possible reasons for these differences have been discussed.   The deposition process used for coating can also play a role in the mechanical properties. A comparative study of the mechanical behaviour of bond coats obtained from the same feedstock but two different processes of deposition: 1) High-Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF), and 2) Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) process was performed. The study shows a significant difference in the elastic-plastic behaviour of the bond coats obtained from the two processes indicating that the deposition process plays an important role in the mechanical behaviour of bond coats. Finally, to understand the difference in the behaviour of the two types of coating, microstructural studies were performed. These studies indicate a significantly larger presence of oxides in coatings deposited using the HVOF process as compared to the VPS process. These oxide particles increase the brittleness of HVOF coatings which leads to lower plastic deformation in them as compared to the VPS coatings.  ","categories": [],

Separation  technology is no exception. 2D nanomaterials possess numerous desirable  properties such as large specific surface area, high aspect ratio,  nanometre level thickness and more, which make them suitable for  separation processes such as membrane separation and sorbent-based  oil-water separation.   This thesis focuses on one such nanomaterial - hexagonal boron nitride  (hBN, a 2D nanomaterial analogous to graphene), and the applications of  hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets in polymer nanocomposites for water  remediation. The first part of the thesis will focus on developing  polymer nanocomposite water filtration membranes to achieve dye  rejection and fouling resistance. Our process involved integrating  functionalized hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets into a polyvinylidene  fluoride and polydopamine interpenetrating network membrane through the  non-solvent-induced phase separation route. The resulting membranes  demonstrate high pure water flux, effective dye rejection over multiple  cycles of operation when tested with anionic and cationic dyes, and high  resistance to fouling on testing with bovine serum albumin as the model  foulant.   The second part of the thesis will focus on developing polymer  nanocomposite foams incorporated with hBN nanosheets for oil-water separation. Separation of oil from oil-contaminated water is pertinent for cleaning up oil spills, leaks, and untreated wastewater  effluents from various industries as the oil can damage marine  ecosystems and have far-reaching, long-lasting repercussions. Selective  oil sorption from oil-contaminated water can be achieved using polymer  foams as sorbents. Herein, we prepared flexible polyurethane (PU) and  polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foams, which were infused with hBN  nanosheets through a facile template leaching process to study the oil  sorption performance of the foams across various model oils. The  selective removal of oil from oil-water stratified mixtures using these  foams was tested under static and agitated conditions. These foams could  retain their sorption capacity over multiple study cycles while  maintaining their structural integrity. In conclusion, this thesis  demonstrates the potential of hexagonal boron nitride nanomaterials and  their polymer nanocomposites in enhancing the current polymer-based  membrane and foam architectures for water remediation applications.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Development of fully printed smart tags with on-chip power sources   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Subho Dasgupta   When?  03rd October, 2024 (Thursday), 03:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  The rapid rise of wearable electronics market has presented the scientific community with various new challenges. This includes finding a reliable local energy source with sufficient energy density to power an electronic chip. In addition, the on-chip energy source should possess an easy fabrication protocol that aligns with the preparation of the electronics on it. Typically, a local high energy density can be offered by an electrochemical energy storage, where a battery on-chip is still a distant dream. Therefore, it is only high energy and power density supercapacitors that can serve the purpose. On the other hand, when it is high volume production of multi-purpose electronic smart tags, printing of the electronic circuits can be a sustainable approach that can combine ease of fabrication, high throughput production with minimal material loss. Among the semiconductor technologies available for printed electronics, the oxide semiconductors are certainly the most reliable, environmentally stable choice, which can offer high mobility electronic transport. On the other hand, among the gating mechanisms that can be chosen for this printed thin film transistor (TFT) technology, an electrolyte-gating combines advantages, such as easy printability, room temperature processing, low operation voltage and excellent semiconductor-insulator interface.   Therefore, this thesis focuses on the positive bias-stress (on-state) stability of inkjet-printed composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE)-gated TFTs with three different indium rich crystalline and amorphous oxide systems, such as In2O3, a-IGO, a-IGZO. The findings suggest that a-IGO may be the optimal solution to obtain excellent bias stress stability as its amorphous (offers excellent semiconductor-electrolyte interface) in nature, thus, results in less bias stress induced defect states. It has shown nominal threshold voltage (Vt) shift, and even a decrease in the subthreshold slope (S) value with continuous biasing for over 12 hours. In addition, only a nominal decrease in the on-state current value by less than 10%, a threshold voltage (Vt) shift by only 0.25 V have been noted. Notably, the on-state performance of the TFTs is essential to demonstrate a power on-chip smart tag operation. At the next step, to demonstrate self-powered electronics, an attempt has been made to fabricate reliable energy storage devices with various printing techniques. In order to achieve this target, inkjet-printed thin film micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with transition metal oxides have been fabricated following an evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) technique. Although extremely high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance values have been achieved with the high surface-to-volume ratio MSC electrodes, however, the absolute or areal capacitance and energy density values have been low to power a complex circuit. In this context, the invention of 2D metallic MXenes have appeared as a revolutionizing solution for the printed micro-supercapacitor applications. The energy density of these supercapacitors can be so high that they are now termed as supercapatteries. In the present work, we have developed a novel additive-free 3D printable ink of 2D Ti3C2Tx exploiting a capillary suspension method to fabricate symmetric supercapatteries. These 3D printed supercapatteries with rheology controlled high viscous inks have demonstrated an unprecedented areal capacitance ~4.7 F/cm2, and energy density as high as ~0.3 mW.h/cm2 with acidic solid electrolyte (0.6 V), which has been found to be sufficient to illuminate a LED circuit with 54 LEDs. However, further invention of a new electrolyte system has been necessary that would offer a high voltage supercapattery (2 V), which is essentially to supply 2 V input voltage to the printed electronic circuit. Combining all these, a standalone high technology barrier anti-counterfeit tag has been fabricated with a visible light-blind UV sensor, which upon UV illumination, particularly already with harmless 365 nm wavelength changes the color of a visual indicator at the output electronic circuit from silvery white to black.

Epoxy is used as matrix in CFRPs in the primary structures of aircrafts such as fuselage, wings and tail parts, due to its superior properties. However, there are many disadvantages in CF/Epoxy laminates such as, slow production rate due to curing, lack of recyclability, brittleness, and susceptibility to catastrophic failure. Additionally, epoxy requires rivets for joining, have a limited pot life, and pose challenges in damage repair. Their sensitivity to high temperatures also restricts their use in applications near engine components. To overcome these problems, high temperature thermoplastics such as PEEK can be used instead of epoxy as matrix. It does not require curing and the presence of phenyl groups in the main backbone chain provides high strength, thermal stability and rigidity to the polymer, and it can be used at high temperatures (150-200oC) for prolonged time without losing structural integrity. However, the surface energy of CF and PEEK are very different. The lack of functional groups and smooth surface of CF increases the difficulty in wetting of PEEK over CF. The poor interface between PEEK and CF will give rise to poor mechanical properties such as interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), Flexural strength (FS), fracture toughness etc. This thesis endeavors to achieve good mechanical as well as functional properties such as, deicing and electromagnetic shielding, and contributes to enhance the current knowledge in CF/PEEK laminates. These properties are highly desirable to perform as a better aerostructural material in the current scenario. It also explores the damage aspects and recovering the properties after damage.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Evolution of oxide layers in heat-treated/deformed CMSX-4 in different  atmospheres   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Surendra Kumar Makineni   When?  16th October, 2024 (Wednesday), 3:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract:  Superalloys are special class of high temperature alloys that are used  for making components in gas-turbine engines, catalytic reactors which  are exposed to highly corrosive atmospheres. These alloys have  exceptional oxidation resistance, creep resistance, high temperature  strength as well as ductility. These alloys are primarily based on Ni,  Co, Fe and Ti because of their high melting point (&gt;1400°C). The  efficiency of an engine primarily relies on higher inlet temperatures.  The higher melting points of these alloys and good oxidation resistant  enable higher working temperature for the engines.   Ni-based superalloys are widely used in aerospace (aircraft engines,  turbine blades) as well as power-generation industries (steam turbines).  Ni does not undergo phase transformations and retains its FCC structure  until melting. Additionally, it can form uniform coherent precipitates,  Ni3(Al, Ti) with ordered L12 structure in the FCC γ matrix. These are  also stable at the application temperatures imparting the required  strength and creep resistance. Moreover, the alloying elements (Ta, Re,  W, Mo) help in improving the creep strength, oxidation resistance and  increasing the solvus temperature. Other elements such as Co, Cr and Hf  are also present in CMSX-4, one of the most popular Ni-based  superalloys.   Aircraft fuels contain hydrocarbons, olefins, paraffins, naphthenes,  aromatics and cycloparaffins. Air is also sucked in from the atmosphere  to enable combustion of the fuel. Therefore, the turbine blades are  exposed to a very harsh mixture of corrosive gases at high temperatures.  Since CMSX-4 consists of ten elements, the process of oxidation is  highly complex. For improving the alloy’s oxidation resistance, it is  important to understand the oxidation process.   In the current study, the evolution of oxide layers during the exposure  of CMSX-4 at 900°C in the presence of four different gases (air, oxygen,  carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide) is studied. These gases are  generally present in the combustion products and are expected to corrode  the turbine blades. The CMSX-4 samples with four different thermal and  mechanical processed conditions having different microstructural  features are studied in this work. These are:           Solutionised state (without γ’ precipitates)            Solutionised and aged at 900oC (standard CMSX-4 with γ-γ’  microstructure)            Aged at 900°C and creep deformed at 800°C (γ-γ’ with stacking faults,  micro twins, and having increased dislocation density)            Aged and creep deformed at 1000°C (γ-γ’ with a high density of γ-γ’  interfacial dislocation network and antiphase boundaries)       These four conditions allowed for exploring the understanding of the  effect of microstructure and defects on oxidation resistance.   The initial part of the study involved the design of the experimental  setup to neutralise CO2 and SO2 gases used for oxidation. Experiments  were conducted in a controlled setup of a three-zone vacuum furnace. The  oxidised samples were characterised by XRD, SEM, EPMA and TEM to  identify the oxidation products. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was  also performed to quantify the mass gain associated with oxidation.   The samples that crept at 800°C had the best oxidation resistance under  air, oxygen and SO2 atmospheres. The standard CMSX-4 (aged sample) had  the highest oxidation resistance only under CO2 atmosphere. The solutionised samples were found to have the lowest oxidation resistance  in all atmospheres. It is found that the resistance to air and oxygen  atmospheres increases when the conditions are favourable for the  diffusion of aluminium to the oxide-metal interface. The oxidation under  CO2 is found to be a balance between the adsorption and reaction  kinetics. The stability of NiSO4 under the reaction conditions decides  the oxidation mechanism under SO2. Overall, with this study, it was  possible to characterize the different oxides formed in different  microstructures under various atmospheres. Additionally, the mechanisms  for oxidising different microstructures under four different atmospheres  were proposed. These results can be utilised to further optimise the  microstructure of the alloy according to the reaction conditions  (presence of carbon, sulphur and oxygen).  ","categories": [],

Heat treatment, composition modifications, and limiting the sustained stress has largely kept this problem at bay. Several of the newest 7XXX alloys have shown a susceptibility to EAC in a warm, humid environment that is not detected using the conventional alternate immersion, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) standard, ASTM G47. This new form of EAC appears to be a mechanism depending on hydrogen assisted grain boundary embrittlement. This is different than the classical SCC anodic dissolution with loss of material via corrosive attach of grain boundaries. There is a safety bulletin from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA SIB 2018-04R2) that proposes a new test method that activates this damage mechanism. It is unclear if this approach is sufficient to screen these new alloys. The problem and future work will be discussed to ensure air worthiness of current USAF systems.   About the Speaker:   Dr. Rosenberger completed his baccalaureate (1986) and master’s (1987) degrees in mechanical engineering at Michigan Technological University. He earned his PhD in 1993, at the University of Rhode Island under the direction of Professor Ghonem. He performed extensive scanning electron microscopic analysis of fracture surfaces and crack tip plastic zones of small cracks at Ecole National Superieure des Mines de Paris (France) during his PhD work. Rosenberger came to the Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH in 1993 as a visiting scientist and became a government civilian in 1997. Currently he is a Senior Materials Research Engineer in AFRL. His current research is focused on conducting innovative experiments on high temperature materials for gas turbine engines and developing techniques to better assess the durability of materials in a high temperature environment. He has an extensive knowledge of nickel base superalloys, their fatigue, fracture, and creep behaviors, and their suitability for use in the aggressive gas turbine engine environment. A current research thrust is to place the design of gas turbine engine components on a more physical basis rather than the largely data-driven approach that has been used in the past. This involves taking experimental observations and developing models that predict the behavior under more complex loading conditions.  ","categories": [],

Despite its importance, water scarcity is a growing global issue due to population growth, economic expansion, and climate change, which strain freshwater resources and exacerbate disparities in access. This imbalance between water availability and demand threatens ecosystems and socio-economic stability. International risk assessments since 2015 have highlighted water scarcity as a major concern. The unequal global distribution and overuse of freshwater are expected to worsen the situation, with the World Economic Forum projecting that by 2050, around two-thirds of the global population will live in areas facing water stress. Therefore, purifying existing water resources is crucial. Primarily driven by population growth, intensified agricultural demands, and rapid industrial expansion, it has been statistically demonstrated that global water consumption has increased manifold since the 1950s. In this scenario, researchers have resorted to Membrane technology, which is considered cost-effective, efficient on a vast scale, environmentally safe, and socially acceptable. An ideal membrane should exhibit high permeability, selectivity, and effectiveness over a wide range of contaminants, be vested with high mechanical stability, and resist fouling.   However conventional membranes often fall short and are unable to meet stringent water standards owing to issues such as fouling and scaling, which eventually leads to membrane failure. A definitive solution to this issue remains elusive. This thesis is motivated by the challenges and seeks to engineer porous membranes via the application of cutting-edge materials like Interpenetrating Polymeric Networks (IPNs).  It can enhance the chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability of polymeric materials, prolonging the system’s lifespan and enabling it to be reused and recycled without sacrificing its effectiveness in removing pollutants. Moreover, IPNs are highly feasible and tailorable, allowing for the use of non-toxic chemicals and solvents, owing to their design flexibility in terms of selecting suitable monomers during the design process for targeted pollutant removal. Furthermore, by modifying the structure of the interpenetrating polymer, it becomes possible to customize the membrane’s pore size and enhance its resistance to fouling and separation capabilities.   This thesis focuses on the design and optimization of polymeric membranes for effective and efficient water remediation. At the onset, the thesis begins primarily with exploring the fundamentals of polymeric membranes and the various methods used for fabricating and modifying them to enhance separation efficiency and prevent fouling, as documented  in the literature. It examines the underlying mechanisms that contribute to separation efficiency and assist in the development of anti-fouling properties. In doing so, the thesis delves into the intricacies of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) and various functional nanomaterials, highlighting their significance in engineering a portfolio of membranes with gradually reducing pore size and increasing surface charge. Furthermore, the latter half of the thesis emphasizes the importance of ensuring sustainability in membrane technologies by fabricating recyclable and high-performing membranes via installing in-situ “exchangeable bonds” (or Covalent Adaptable Networks, CANs) directly at the outset of the fabrication process. The existence of exchangeable bonds facilitated the integration of closed-loop circularity within the membranes, thereby creating a route for the reutilization of fouled membranes. The designed membranes can revolutionize membrane technology by providing straightforward regeneration techniques and promoting a transition towards circular approaches in product life cycles, significantly improving membrane waste management.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Kapil Kumar Gupta  Tenure Track Researcher, Section of Materials and Surface Engineering (MTU), Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering,Technical University of Denmark   When?  8th November, 2024 (Friday), 4.00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore   Abstract:   Corrosion research is essential for advancing sustainable technologies and overcoming challenges in the green energy sector. One critical area is carbon capture and storage (CCS), which, despite its importance for climate mitigation, faces significant corrosion challenges in pipelines and storage systems due to impurity interactions and the formation of corroding species. The presence of impurities in the CO2 stream (such as H2O, H2S, SOx, NOx, etc.) can considerably lower the solubility of water resulting in water dropout with lower pH values and further increase corrosivity. Traditional methods for predicting and studying corrosion have been an area of focus, however, they often fall short in addressing the complex, multifaceted nature of corrosion processes under varying environmental conditions. This gap underscores the necessity for a more advanced, efficient, and predictive analytics approaches. By leveraging predictive analytics techniques, this research aims to predict corrosion rates in CCS applications, taking into account the diverse and dynamic nature of impurities present in CO2 streams. Understanding these mechanisms and developing predictive AI models are essential for ensuring long-term safety and operational feasibility.   Additionally, corrosion in energy production, conversion, and distribution poses significant sustainability challenges. High-voltage electronic components, such as those in wind turbines, solar power systems, and electric vehicles, are particularly affected. As the industry shifts towards higher voltage applications and miniaturized designs, the risk of corrosion-induced failures increases due to higher electric fields and leakage currents, especially in humid conditions. This can lead to dendrite formation and device failure. Similarly, corrosion of accessory components in alkaline electrolyzers, not only affects the safety and reliability of the electrolyzer systems but also impact the hydrogen production efficiency, due to the implications of metallic ion deposition from accessory materials. Understanding the mechanisms and addressing all these issues through better material selection, protective measures, and predictive models are emphasized as critical to maintaining the integrity of green technologies.

The Open AM initiative at DTU addresses these limitations through an open architecture model that empowers researchers to modify system parameters, integrate custom sensors, and rapidly iterate designs. This open framework has accelerated materials discovery and fosters a collaborative research environment, facilitating widespread knowledge sharing and scaling of innovations across disciplines. We focus on two technology platforms namely laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and Vat Photopolymerization (VPP).   In LPBF, open-architecture systems enable precise alloy design and microstructural control. By fine-tuning thermal profiles and alloy compositions, we develop materials with targeted properties such as enhanced hardness, corrosion resistance, and ductility. Open LPBF platforms also support in-situ alloying and sensor integration. In VPP, open-architecture systems extend the resolution limits of AM, achieving high-precision components in polymers, ceramics, and metals. The controlled curing depths, viscosity, and exposure in open VPP systems allow for the fabrication of complex structures with exceptional resolution. High-resolution ceramics, in particular, show great potential in energy applications such as solid oxide cells.   The talk will discuss how open AM systems are transforming materials and manufacturing by fostering rapid innovation. By moving beyond the restrictions of closed AM models, open architecture facilitates the development of sustainable, high-performance materials tailored to meet diverse research and industrial needs.

However, the coating formation is stimulated by applying electrical energy and the resulting high energy plasma discharges are converting the surface into oxide-based ceramics. Effective surface temperatures are around 2000°C and thus any kind of additives to the treatment bathes are likely to be decomposed and/or react with the coating components in the melt pools generated by the discharges. Thus, most of the in-situ approaches to form smart PEO coatings are failing. However, post-treatments using the porosity as micro-/macrocontainer and/or layer double hydroxide formation to create “smart” protective hybrid coatings are an option. These hybrid coatings provide both barrier and “smart” protection to the magnesium and aluminium substrates.   The presentation will review the available approaches to produce smart PEO coatings for corrosion protection and discuss the still existing challenges which needs to overcome for broader industrial applications.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Maria Serdechnova  Research Scientist, Institute of Functional Surfaces, Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon, Geesthacht, Germany   When?  5th December, 2024 (Thursday), 3.00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore   Abstract:   For many years, the corrosion protection of Mg and Al alloys was dominated by chromate-based coating solutions. Nowadays, the use of chromates is strictly limited in industrial applications due to their high toxicity. Thus, new alternative coating approaches for aluminum and magnesium need to be developed. Application of LDH-based conversion coatings is a promising direction for corrosion protection of these active light metals. High interest to LDH-based coatings is related to the possibility of loading of corrosion inhibitors into LDH structures and the formation of self-healing layers. However, differences in reactivity of magnesium and aluminum substrates require different approaches to LDH-based surface treatments.   LDH formation is a typical conversion process requiring compounds from the substrate and from the electrolyte. Thus, surface reactivity of both selected metals is an important point, which was addressed by theoretical (thermodynamic calculations) and experimental (laboratory experiments) approaches, to identify suitable chelating agents, which are able to moderate the surface reactivity, resulting in a formation of LDH-based conversion layer. Moreover, anodization and plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) pre-treatments, as methods modifying the surface reactivity, were considered prior LDH formation in order to create “smart” protective hybrid coatings. These hybrid coatings provide both barrier and “smart” protection to the active substrate (magnesium and aluminum alloys as well as their galvanic couple combination). However, the direct replication of treatments, leading to LDH formation on bare substrates, is not possible for pre-treated materials due to the different reactivity of the surfaces and availability of cations from the substrates. Thus, the demand for selection of suitable chelating agents becomes even more challenging.   During the presentation, a short “story” of LDH development on aluminum and magnesium substrates will be presented. The comparison of LDH formation conditions will be performed and will be followed by the discussion of roles of chelating agents during the synthesis. The reactivity of selected surfaces will be taken in focus during the talk.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Inkjet-printed transistors and circuits with two-dimensional semiconductors   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Subho Dasgupta   When?  06th December, 2024 (Friday), 03:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The escalating demand for wearables and large-area electronics has underscored the critical necessity for pioneering semiconducting materials. While organic semiconductors offer flexibility and processability at lower temperatures, their performance and ambient stability is generally constrained. The other explored material class - oxide semiconductors, is limited by their high processing temperatures. In contrast, inorganic two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit properties conducive to the next generation of large-area and flexible devices, including appropriate band gaps, intrinsic flexibility, and the availability of both n-type and p-type semiconductors.   Various techniques exist for the large-scale synthesis of 2D materials, with chemical and physical vapor deposition imposing substrate limitations due to high required temperatures. Conversely, solution-based techniques provide substrate flexibility by operating at lower temperatures and obviate the need for high vacuum systems. When integrated with printing, solution-based techniques can allow roll-to-roll processing of inexpensive electronic devices through which disposable electronics can be realized.   Pointing out the advantages mentioned above, several groups have attempted to build transistors with solution-processed two-dimensional semiconductors. These reports demonstrate network transistors built with semiconductors from Group VI TMD, such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, etc. In a solution-processed film, there is a network of flakes, and the transport of charge carriers takes place through a lot of flakes and the respective inter-flake junctions. These inter-flake junctions introduce many non-tunable resistors and, as a result, control the overall electrical properties of the cast film. Due to this reason, it is difficult to take advantage of the intrinsic properties of solution-processed 2D semiconductors that are shown with the devices fabricated on single flakes. As a result, the attempts to build transistors on solution-processed flakes fall short of those built on single flakes of these devices. The films were made thicker in the initial reports to overcome the high inter-flake resistance and improve their conductance. However, the thicker semiconductor leads to poor dielectric control of the semiconducting films, resulting in much reduced On-Off ratios. Later, the occurrence of junctions is reduced by utilizing larger flakes. The larger flakes resulted in better transistor performance, but the larger size limits their fabrication through digital techniques such as inkjet printing. Another attempt is made where the flakes are covalently bonded to each other through diothiolated conjugated molecules. These improve the percolation pathway for flakes; however, the improvement in transistor properties was not substantial.   This report addresses the bottleneck of junction resistance by presenting several methods to achieve high-performance 2D transistors and circuits. Firstly, an innovative device geometry is proposed to transform the conduction to the vertical dimension of the film, which is several tens of nanometers, instead of conduction laterally, which is several tens of micrometers. As a result, the transport is now not limited by inter-flake junctions; instead, we observe intra-flake properties. High-performance n-type transistors of MoS2 exfoliated through several techniques are fabricated utilizing this geometry. The MoS2 transistors built with this geometry demonstrate a high reproducibility with a current density of 300 μA.μm-1 and an On-Off ratio of 107. Enjoying the high-performance transistors, we have shown inverters and several logic gates such as NAND, NOR, AND, and OR. The respective DC and AC performance has been analyzed. A maximum gain of 31 is demonstrated at a supply voltage of 1.5 V, and all the circuits are shown to operate at 1 kHz. In the next section, we built high-performance p-type transistors with solution-processed tellurium and a similar geometry. Then, the n-type MOS2 and p-type tellurium are used to make CMOS inverters.   In the next approach we approached the problem by inducing partial metallicity on the flakes. For this we took pre-doped MoS2 single crystals. These crystals are then electrochemically exfoliated and dispersed in solution. The partial metallic phase on these flakes is found to lower the junction resistance substantially, and transistors with channel lengths as high as 150 μm are demonstrated. Interestingly, the metallic nature does not increase the off current in transistors, and we observe a high On-Off ratio of 107. Moreover, we also observe a high current density of 280 μA.μm-1. These transistors could be fabricated at room temperature giving us an opportunity to build the devices on flexible substrates. Subsequently, we built fully printed devices on paper substrates with screen printed MXenes as the drive electrodes. In summary, in this work, we have emphasized the importance of junction resistance on the transistor properties of solution-processed 2D semiconductors. We have provided solutions to overcome the junction resistance and demonstrated high-performance devices.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Sustainable Strategies for E-Waste Management: Bio- Derived Substrates and Heavy metal Remediation Techniques   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Praveen Ramamurthy   When?  12th December, 2024 (Thursday), 10:30 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Monitoring pollution levels and extent is crucial for preserving our environment’s sustainability. Advances in the technology sector, facilitated by new materials and methods, have significantly improved.  Nonetheless, these advancements have resulted in an increase in electronic waste (e-waste), posing a significant environmental risk. If not properly managed, the disposal of e-waste can lead to the release of harmful metals and organic substances into soil and water, endangering ecosystems. This thesis delineates the various sources of e-waste and the current state of remediation, focusing on encapsulation, sensing, and the development of biodegradable alternatives. It specifically addresses two primary sources of electronic waste: lead-perovskite solar cells and plastic substrates used in PCB (Printed Circuit Board)  applications and electronic substrates.   The renewable energy sector’s extensive use of solar cells, particularly perovskites, has propelled forward the search for new materials.  Lead-containing perovskite solar cells have shown to increase photovoltaic power conversion efficiency significantly. Despite the exploration of lead-free alternatives, current research suggests that the most efficient and dependable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilize lead salts, which are harmful to both human health and the environment.  This research integrates encapsulation modifications and sensing technologies to address lead leaching from perovskite solar cells effectively. Encapsulation involves the physical containment of a device within a polymer film that has functional groups capable of binding with lead ions, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of Surlyn beyond its traditional use in photovoltaic packaging. This method leverages the affinity of lead for amine-functionalized molecules for both sensing and encapsulation purposes. A metal-organic framework, ZIF-67, coated over Surlyn, demonstrated a remarkable reduction in lead leakage.  Appropriately functionalized ZIF, was used to detect lead from degraded perovskite solar cells, with a detection limit of 60 ppb. This sensor exhibited remarkable sensitivity in detecting lead ions in water  samples, proving its efficacy in practical applications.   Another focal point of this thesis is the development of flexible cellulose films and composites for packaging, electronic substrates for PCBs, and flexible devices. Cellulose extracted from sugarcane bagasse was crosslinked to create a biodegradable film with a water vapor transmission rate of 350 g/m²/day, suitable for both packaging and device substrates. Additionally, an innovative approach involved replacing conventional plastic PCB substrates with those incorporating biodegradable components. Epoxy-silane functionalized microcrystalline cellulose (SMC) composites were developed, exhibiting a dielectric constant ranging from 10 to 14 across frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz  while maintaining adequate mechanical properties.

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Thermoresponsive CuS-based Nanocomposites Mimicking Red Blood Cells for  Combinatorial Therapy and Photoacoustic Imaging   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Ashok M Raichur   When?  13th December, 2024 (Friday), 06:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  Online   Abstract  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a major public health threat  in the US, even with successful early-stage surgeries. Recurrence and  advanced stages present complex diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.  Traditional treatments, such  as chemotherapy and targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (TKIs), face is-  sues including non-specific targeting, toxicity, poor absorption, and  the development  of resistance. Overcoming resistance due to genetic mutations and tumor  hetero-  geneity is crucial, highlighting the need to identify novel  vulnerabilities in NSCLC for  continued treatment progress. Also, combination therapy is being widely  explored to  overcome this problem. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising  emerging cancer  treatment. PTT uses photothermal transduction agents (PTAs) to convert  light energy  into heat, inducing cancer cell death. PTT’s advantages include precise  tumor targeting  through adjustable laser irradiation, minimizing damage to healthy  tissues, and being a  highly effective, non-invasive treatment. Effective PTAs should have  high photothermal  conversion efficiency (PCE), non-overlapping absorption with tumor  background, and  strong tumor accumulation.  Moreover, PTT agents can serve as exogenous contrast agents for  photoacoustic  imaging (PAI), enabling light-based theranostics. PAI is a non-invasive  imaging tech-  nique that uses light and sound waves to produce high-resolution optical  images of  internal tissues. Combined with PTT, PAI can track the delivery of  light-absorbing PTT  agents to the target site and monitor the treatment in real-time,  minimizing damage  to healthy tissues. This approach reduces side effects and increases  treatment effec-  tiveness. Nano PTAs, which leverage the enhanced permeability and  retention (EPR)  effect and active targeting, show particular promise.  Past decades have seen advancement in nanoparticle-based drug delivery  plat-  forms. However, advancements in nano-drug delivery platforms often face  challenges  in penetrating deep into the tumor microenvironment due to their size  and design.  Smaller nanoparticles can penetrate deeply but are easily washed away,  while larger  ones remain at the tumor site but fail to penetrate deeply. Modifying  nanoparticle size,  surface chemistry, and other properties can improve circulation time,  tumor targeting,and penetration. Innovative designs that change size  upon reaching the tumor site can  enhance circulation and effective tumor distribution. Addressing these  challenges and  exploring new strategies can maximize the potential of nanoparticle drug  delivery for  improved cancer treatment outcomes.  To address the current gaps in the field, we have explored the loading  of CuS  nanoparticles (5-20 nm) into smart thermoresponsive nanogels (200-225  nm) along-  side an FDA-approved TKI for lung cancer, targeting the EGFR to achieve  stimuli-  responsive combinatorial therapy. This innovative multi-stage approach  has aimed to  enhance deep tumor targeting. Upon encountering specific stimuli, the  nanogel has  been designed to degrade in the tumor environment, facilitating the  targeted release of  the drug into the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we have aimed to  investigate  the potential of coating this loaded nanogel with RBC membrane, thereby  mimicking its  behavior to avoid opsonization. Combining CuS nanoparticles, a targeted  drug, and a  stimuli-responsive release mechanism within a nanogel system, this study  should offer  a promising strategy for achieving more effective and precise deep tumor  theranostics  for lung cancer.  The first task was to prepare CuS nanoparticles with appropriate  photothermal ef-  ficiency, along with suitable particle size and molecular targeting  capability. We syn-  thesized CuS nanoparticles with PVP as a stabilizing agent, producing  PC10, PCK30,  and PC40 variants. We investigated how different PVP molecular weights  affect their  crystalline properties and photoacoustic/photothermal responses. All  nanoparticles  showed a crystalline structure, were &lt;(&gt;«)&gt;10 nm, and exhibited  absorbance peaks at 1020  nm, indicating strong photoacoustic and photothermal capabilities. PC10  stood out with  superior photoacoustic properties and achieved a remarkable photothermal  efficiency  of 51%. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed cell compatibility and enhanced  apoptosis rates.  These results highlight the potential of PVP-stabilized CuS  nanoparticles for advanced  cancer theranostics. The system’s crucial limitation was the inability  to achieve tar-  geted functionality without complex ring-opening reactions. We then  investigated an  alternative system aiming for both optimal photothermal efficiency and  targeted deliv-  ery.  Prior studies have shown anti-cancer properties of functionalized gold  (Au) nanoparticles, leading to the exploration of CuS/Au nanohybrids for  imaging and therapy. This  study focuses on developing ultra-small CuS-Au (TSP-CA) nanohybrids  using seed-  mediated galvanic reduction with tannic acid (TA) and sodium citrate  (SC) as reducing  agents. PVP-CuS nanoparticles, prepared from previous research, were  used, and  TSP-CA nanohybrids averaging 8 nm in size were formed, confirmed by  X-ray photo-  electron spectroscopy (XPS) showing the presence of Cu and Au.  Photoacoustic (PA)  experiments showed a higher signal-to-noise ratio, with photothermal  therapy (PTT)  efficiency estimated at 25%, demonstrating good photostability. In vitro  experiments  indicated ROS-mediated anticancer effects on lung cancer cells. Ex vivo  studies using  chicken breast confirmed PTT and PA signal generation at depths of 1 cm  and 1.5 cm,  with PA signals measured using a 2.25 MHz ultrasound transducer and a  960 nm laser  at 1 cm depth. ROS and apoptosis studies revealed enhanced anticancer  effects of  the hybrid nanoparticles compared to individual nanoparticles. However,  this system  showed a considerable decrease in photothermal efficiency compared to  our previous  study. This decrease would compel us to use higher concentrations of  particles to  achieve the desired anti-cancer effect. We moved on to exploring other  materials for  CuS synthesis, which could offer the desired properties.  While the interaction between mucin and cancer cells is still under  exploration,  mucin shows promise for developing nanoparticles for theranostics due to  its stability-  enhancing properties. However, mucin has not yet been utilized to  synthesize copper  sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles. This study investigates using mucin as a  capping agent for  CuS (Mu@CuS) nanoparticles to enhance stability for optical theranostic  applications.  The resulting nanoparticles, less than 10 nm in size, were crystalline  and exhibited  absorbance in the NIR II region, demonstrating optimal photothermal  efficiency (38%)  and photoacoustic contrast abilities. To explore targeting ability and  cellular uptake,  Rhodamine B was conjugated to the mucin-coated CuS nanoparticles  (Mu@CuS-Rh),  exploiting the negative charges on cancer cell membranes for  mitochondrial delivery.  Experiments on 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid models showed deep tumor  pene-  tration and effective photothermal therapeutic effects. Since the  particles exhibited all  the desirable attributes, they were tested for deep tumor penetration  ability in vivo.  In vivo, Multispectral optoacoustic imaging analysis of Mu@CuS-Rh  nanoparticles re-  vealed significant tumor uptake and retention for up to 7 hours, with  notable accumulation in hypoxic tumor regions. Interestingly, these  particles underscore the potential of  Mu@CuS nanoparticles for hypoxic tumor imaging and targeted therapy as  well.  A thermoresponsive nanogel was developed using NIPAM and MAA to ensure  ma-  terial delivery only upon thermal stimulation. Various NIPAM and MAA  ratios were  tested to achieve a sol-gel transition temperature above body  temperature. At 8% MAA,  the transition temperature rose to 35°C, with most of the transition  occurring above  40°C, indicating potential for temperature-triggered drug release. To  address gaps  in the field, CuS nanoparticles were loaded into these nanogels along  with the FDA-  approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib, targeting EGFR receptors  in lung cancer.  Mu@CuS was incorporated in situ during polymerization, while Erlotinib  was loaded  post-synthesis. TEM and SEM characterization confirmed successful  loading. Combi-  nation anti-cancer studies on lung cancer cell lines showed that the  concentrations of  Mu@CuS and Erlotinib could be reduced when used together, indicating a  synergistic  effect. Furthermore, the loaded nanogel was wrapped with an RBC membrane  to form  a composite (R@Ng-MuC/Er) for combinatorial theranostics. The  photothermal evalu-  ation showed that the composite nanoparticles could increase the  temperature to 50°C  when 1 mg was dispersed in PBS. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies  demonstrated  the composite’s superior efficiency over Mu@CuS and Erlotinib alone. In  vivo studies  indicated significant tumor reduction in mice treated with R@Ng-MuC/Er,  without toxic  effects on major organs, as suggested by histology. Also, multispectral  optoacoustic  tomography suggested appropriate composite accumulation in the tumor  microenvi-  ronment, further explored for imaging and therapy. A biodistribution  study suggested  major clearance of particles by the liver. The diagnostic properties  were evaluated  using MSOT, confirming the composite’s potential for precise tumor  theranostics.  In conclusion, the developed system successfully achieved all the  objectives of our  study. Among various CuS nanoparticles, mucin-coated CuS nanoparticles  (Mu@CuS)  exhibited the most promising therapeutic potential. These nanoparticles  showed en-  hanced interaction with tumor cells, even in hypoxic conditions.  Combined with Erlotinib  and loaded into thermoresponsive nanogels, they provided a synergistic  effect for com-  binatorial chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, ensuring on-demand  release and  minimizing unnecessary interactions with normal cells. The potential of  these nanopar  ticles for photoacoustic tomography further supports their use in  image-guided cancer  therapy. Their similarity to red blood cells suggests significant  potential to evade im-  mune responses, though further characterization is needed. In vivo  experiments re-  vealed substantial tumor regression with tumor imaging properties,  highlighting their  promising potential for lung cancer treatment. This system warrants  further evaluation  to advance towards clinical translation.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Additive Manufacturing of Titanium Alloys for Orthopaedic applications:  Processing-Microstructure-Property-Function Relationship   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Satyam Suwas (Co-Supervisor - Prof. Kaushik Chatterjee)   When?  19th December, 2024 (Thursday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Metallic implants are crucial for osteosynthesis, aiming for effective  healing outcomes. These situations often demand patient-specific  treatments, as standard implants may not deliver expected functional  outcomes. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a promising solution by  enabling the fabrication of near-net shape parts. However, the  properties of AM-fabricated alloys differ significantly from  conventionally processed ones due to inherent high cooling rates and  thermal gradients during AM, thus altering the microstructural features.   In this thesis, two different Ti alloys, namely Ti-6Al-4V ELI (α+β) and  Ti-35Nb-5Ta-7Zr (β) were investigated for biomedical applications,  particularly for load-bearing orthopedic implants. The first part of the  thesis is focused on applying cyclic heat treatment to modify the  microstructure of bone plates (prepared by selective laser melting, SLM)  from acicular martensite to bimodal, significantly enhancing  biomechanical performance, especially in bending. A comparison between  additively manufactured, heat-treated (HT), and wrought (WR) Ti-6Al-4V  ELI (Ti64) has been brought out, considering microstructural (including  texture), mechanical, electrochemical, and biological aspects. The study  revealed comparable biomechanical performance between additively  manufactured materials after heat treatment and wrought materials.  Subsequent fracture toughness evaluation indicated poorer values for AM  samples, showing strong anisotropy in crack initiation along the build  direction. However, heat treatment effectively improved fracture  toughness in both orientations. It has been observed that hard  orientations impede crack initiation, while twinning activity aids in  blunting crack tips and limiting propagation. Tribocorrosion  measurements revealed much more wear volume loss due to the synergistic  effect of wear and corrosion. The mechanism of tribocorrosion varied  depending on the testing conditions; wear was dominant under open  circuit potential (OCP) conditions, whereas wear-induced corrosion  prevailed under Potentiostatic conditions. The performance of HT samples  was significantly improved compared to wrought Ti64, as reported in the  literature.   Building on these findings, patient-specific implants, biomechanically  improved post AM through heat treatment, were evaluated in human  subjects with upper limb complications, resulting in safe and effective  treatment for malunions and deformities, with reduced surgical time.  This constitutes the second part of the thesis.   The last part is focused on developing an alloy with the composition  Ti-35Nb-5Ta-7Zr using directed energy deposition (DED) technique. Nearly  dense components exhibited complete β phase stability, lower elastic  modulus, strong crystallographic texture, high strength, good ductility,  excellent corrosion resistance, and cytocompatibility.   Overall, the work presented in the thesis has important implications for  development and translation of additively manufactured Ti alloys for  orthopedic implants.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Effect of Microstructural Evolution on the Electrochemical Degradation Behaviour of Electrodeposited Tin-Based Coatings   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Chandan Srivastava   When?  06th January, 2025 (Monday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  Online   Abstract  Electroplated Sn has been used as a protective coating against corrosion, as an anode material for rechargeable Li-ion battery, decorative finishes, and electronic packaging. The application of electrodeposited Sn is limited by its electrochemical degradation which reduces liability and increases the operating cost. In the present work, the corrosion behavior of electrodeposited Sn-based coatings (Sn-Ni, Sn-Zn, and Sn-Bi) has been studied by examining the corrosion products, the spatial distribution of phase, solute clustering/partitioning within the matrix, micro-texture, and coating strain. Key observations of the current work are: (i) Optimum incorporation of Ni in Sn coating (6 wt% Ni) produced a highly corrosion-resistant Sn-Ni coating with Ni3Sn4 intermetallic occupying the grain boundaries, low energy (100) orientated Sn matrix, highest fraction of low energy (031) [0 3] and (0 1) [011] twin boundaries and lower matrix strain. Contrary, higher Ni addition (13 wt% Ni) degraded the corrosion resistance of the Sn-Ni coating, due to galvanic coupling between the anodic Sn-rich matrix and cathodic intermetallic phase (Ni3Sn4), and the evolution of high energy texture characterized by a high fraction of high energy high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), high matrix strain, and low fraction of low energy twin boundaries, (ii) A non-monotonic variation in the corrosion rate of the Sn-Bi coatings with Bi addition (0-17 wt% Bi) was noted. A highly corrosion-resistant Sn-Bi coating was produced at an optimum Bi incorporation (14 wt% Bi). Sn clusters in Bi-rich grains strained the Bi grains, thus lowering its effective passiveness and reducing the extent of micro-galvanic coupling between Sn-rich (anodic) and Bi-rich (cathodic) grains. The increase in the corrosion resistance for optimum Bi content was also due to the evolution of surface texture (of the matrix Sn phase) corresponding to low energy (101) orientation and the highest fraction of low-energy CSL boundaries. (iii) In Sn-14wt%Bi, coatings electrodeposited at different cathodic current densities (5, 12, 25, and 40 mA/cm2), the highest corrosion resistance was observed for the coating electrodeposited at the 25 mA/cm2 current density. This was due to low energy (301) surface texture, the evolution of the Sn-1.2at% Bi solid solution phase, and the formation of the SnO2 oxide passive layer. The lowest corrosion resistance observed for 40 mA/cm2 deposited coating was due to high energy (110) surface texture, formation of Bi-enriched clusters in the Sn matrix, and an unstable passive layer consisting of SnO and Sn(OH)2 oxides. (iv) Corrosion resistance of Sn-Zn coatings decreased at lower quantities of Zn addition (up to 10 wt%) but increased substantially at higher Zn contents (20-25 wt% Zn). At higher Zn additions, the enhanced corrosion resistance was due to a higher fraction of low energy, coincidence site lattice boundaries (CSLs), and preferred low-energy (100) surface texture. On the other hand, a higher corrosion rate for lower Zn addition stemmed from a highly strained matrix and a relatively higher fraction of high-energy, HAGBs, (v) A non-monotonic variation in the corrosion rate of the Sn-23wt% coating with increased deposition current (7, 12, 17, and 22 mA/cm2) was noticed. The coating deposited at 12 mA/cm2 exhibited the highest corrosion resistance due to relatively lower energy surface texture, higher fraction of lower energy grain boundaries, lesser coating strain, and evolution of protective oxide film with stabler oxides (ZnO and SnO2). Higher energy (110) surface grain orientation, unstable b-Sn matrix due to embedded Zn-enriched clusters, and weak passive layer consisting of Zn0 led to the lowest corrosion resistance for coating electrodeposited at 17 mA/cm2.

In this talk, I will discuss the electrical transport properties of few-layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) showing insulator-to-metallic phase transition under applied electric field. Charge carrier mobility of a few layered ReS2 and MoSe2 FET devices increases as a function of decreasing temperature. Despite defects and impurities, evidence of a metallic state was observed at low temperature using an applied gate voltage or, equivalently, increasing the density of charge carriers within the 2D channel. We analyzed the conductivity data to explore the nature of the phase transition using temperature scaling analysis to distinguish the QPT and percolation nature of phase transition. In the second part of my talk, I will provide an overview of our recently developed high-density capacitive energy storage device on 2D nanofiller based dielectric polymer nanocomposites thin film capacitor where 2D fillers are placed in a stratified manner in the polymer matrix to improve the polarization and breakdown strength of the dielectric capacitors.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Keith Tobias Butler  Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry, University College London   When?  09th January, 2025 (Thursday), 3.00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept. of Materials Engineering, IISc, Bangalore   Abstract:   The discovery and design of new materials is critical for advancing carbon-emission reducing technologies such as renewable energy and electric vehicles. Experimental discovery of new materials is typically slow and costly, quantum mechanics (QM) calculations have brought computational materials design within reach. However, QM calculations are often limited to relatively small sets of materials, as their computational costs are too great for large-scale screening, this is the case for calculating properties required for new energy materials. New methods in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as a powerful complementary tool to QM calculations – learning rules from data calculated from QM and applying cheap, efficient models to explore large chemical spaces. However, several challenges still exist for example, learning from small and limited datasets, obtaining measures of confidence in models and understanding the results of DL models. All these challenges must be addressed to fully realise the power of DL for design of new sustainable materials. In this talk I will give examples of recent work in our group to address these issues, including using unsupervised learning to accelerate the characterisation of battery materials without requiring labelled data[1],   building models with reliable uncertainty quantification [2], capable of learning on significantly smaller datasets than regular DL models, learning general models on large and varied datasets [3] and using DL to match experimental and simulated data [4]. Finally, I will also discuss how the latest developments in large language models could help to solve the challenges of crystal structure prediction [5].
