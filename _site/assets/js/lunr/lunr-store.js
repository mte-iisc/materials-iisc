Using first-principles theoretical analysis, we predict ferroelectricity in 2-D materials like 1T-MoS2 and h-NbN, and demonstrate how it originates from strongly coupled electrons and phonons. While these allow dipolectronic devices based on ultimately thin active channels, experimental realization of such devices and their scalable fabrication are quite challenging. To this end, we report scale-free ferroelectricity in which sub-nano meter thin ferroelectric layers are naturally embedded in 2-dimensional crystalline architecture of orthorhombic structure of HfO2, a material that is already a part of current semiconductor technologies, opening up ultimately high density ferroelectric memory devices.

        "title": "Materials Design: From Grain Boundary Mobilities to Additive Manufacturing  (09/02/21)",
        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. Peter Voorhees   Frank C. Engelhart  Professor of Materials Science and Engineering   Northwestern University  Illinois, USA    When?  9th February, 2021 (Tuesday), 08:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The classical method for designing materials to achieve certain performance goals involves a laborious procedure wherein intuition drives the design of a material that is then created and tested. In most cases, the performance goals are not achieved, and this costly procedure is repeated. By integrating data, computations, and artificial intelligence it is possible to break this expensive cycle and bring innovative new materials to the marketplace faster and at a lesser expense. The materials design process requires links between processing conditions and the resulting microstructure. We illustrate an approach to coupling the processing conditions of additive manufacturing (AM) to microstructure. A phase field model has been developed that follows the evolution of thousands of grains in three dimensions as a heat source propagates along a surface at the high rates seen during AM. Through this approach it is possible to determine the effects of the solidification conditions, the weld pool geometry, and multiple passes of the heat source on the resulting grain morphology. We also discuss a new method for determining difficult-to-measure materials parameters (data needed for design), in this case grain boundary mobilities. The mobility of grain boundaries is thought to be determined by the crystallography of the adjacent crystals. Through a direct comparison of a three-dimensional experimental movie to simulations of the evolution of 1500 grains in iron we have determined over 1600 reduced grain boundary mobilities. We find that the reduced mobilities vary by three orders of magnitude and exhibit no correlation with the boundary crystallography. This implies that factors other than crystallography set grain boundary mobilities. This brings new challenges to predicting the kinetics of grain growth in polycrystalline materials.

Ordered intermetallic precipitates are generally resistant to shearing by dislocations, resulting in strengthening, but are also effective for damage tolerance since they will ultimately deform plastically in the presence of high local stresses.  Ni-base superalloys are prototypical examples wherein L12 precipitates strengthen the solid solution nickel alloy matrix to high fractions of melting.  The contribution of precipitate shearing to overall plasticity in Ni-base alloys has to date been assessed via post-deformed transmission electron microscopy studies of mechanically deformed samples.  We report here on a novel in-situ approach to studying precipitate shearing and faulting in superalloys.   This approach integrates MEMs straining stages with a STEM detector in the SEM, enabling dynamic observations of defects and their interactions with precipitates, faults and boundaries, studied with diffraction contrast.  New insights on the frequency of shearing and the faulting mechanisms will be reported and the implications for alloy design will be discussed.     ","categories": [],

G. M. Michell, Gustave Eiffel, and more. Investigations into topology optimization of structures in the last three decades makes us wonder how optimal structures were conceived before mathematical and computational tools were available. In this talk, we begin with the ideas of Maxwell and Michell and discuss how gradient-based topology optimization is used today with a standard template of design parameterization and adjoint sensitivity analysis.   ‘Material interpolation’, which is the key idea in topology optimization, will be discussed in the context of Multiphysics problems in structures and compliant mechanisms. A few examples of both will be presented in this talk. Architects too are embracing topology optimization. A passing reference will be made to the aesthetics in structural design following the ideas of M. C. Escher.   There has been a recent surge of interest in this field due to emerging additive manufacturing. This connects topology optimization of structures to ‘metamaterial design’. A natural extension of this is simultaneous optimization of structures and materials. Towards this, the talk will conclude with ongoing efforts in the design of fiber-reinforced structures and lattice structures with anisotropy and heterogeneity to achieve optimality.

One important drawback of these steels is a continuous cyclic softening; i.e. they lose strength continuously under strain-controlled cyclic loading. This is mostly attributed to the instability of their tempered martensitic structure. To overcome this shortcoming, a small amount of highly stable nano-oxide particles can be distributed into their matrix in order to form so-called oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels. This not only improves high-temperature tensile properties and creep resistance, but also assists in mitigating undesirable cyclic softening at elevated temperatures. Another critical concern for structural materials that undergo cyclic loading is slip localization. Cyclic slip localization starts early in the fatigue life and manifests in the form of distinct dislocation structures formation such as persistent slip bands (PSBs). PSBs are typically related to the formation of extrusions and intrusions, where fatigue cracks are known nucleate. Taking two complexconcentrated alloys as materials system examples, cyclic slip localization is shown to be mitigated by altering stacking-fault energy. Furthermore, for high temperature applications, oxide dispersion strengthening is also successfully employed  ","categories": [],

The understanding of the material physics embodied by chemistryprocessing-structure-property correlation falls short due to the rapid developments in these fields. In this talk, I will discuss microstructural evolution during advanced manufacturing processes like Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Processing parameters during laser based additive manufacturing affect the fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification characteristics in the melt pool, leading to microstructural variants of texture, grain size, and morphology. A finite volume based Computational Fluid Dynamics model coupled with solidification physics has been developed to predict melting, flow, solidification, and resulting microstructural characteristics during such processes. The variation of texture, grain size and columnar/equiaxed morphology of the grains with laser power and speed has been verified against experiments. The difference in cooling curves and evolution of temperature gradients and cooling rates during solidification leading to a difference in each microstructural variant has been identified. Lower laser power and higher scan rates lead to “unconstrained” solidification with small variation of solidification times across the melt pool depth leading to finer grain structure with lower grain boundary misorientations. On the other hand, higher power and lower scan rates lead to “constrained” solidification, with huge variations in solidification times, coarser grains and highly misoriented grain boundaries. Hunt’s criterion-based processing maps for understanding the morphological variants has been prepared for systematic design of microstructure during the SLM process. In the next part, I will briefly present my work on a robust multiscale computational approach to design electrochemical materials for Solid Oxide Fuel/Electrolyzer Cells (SOF/EC). The depletion of fossil fuels and rapidly deteriorating ‘global warming’ situation with climate change has created a demand for the greener and renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Understanding the electrochemical characteristics of materials used for these technologies is the first step towards material design. The prediction of electrochemical characteristics for protonconducting Yttrium doped Barium Zirconate based SOF/EC, using a multiscale framework combining physics at the atomistic, meso, and continuum scales will be discussed. I will also talk about uncertainty quantification and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and random forest to optimize chemistry for different temperatures and atmospheres for pure/doped perovskites. These projects provide new scientific insights and demonstrate the possible application of the introduced methodology for virtual certification of the next generation of high-performance materials and manufactured products.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. R. Balamuralikrishnan   Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL)   Hyderabad    When?  21th September, 2021 (Thursday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  High performance steels deliver excellent performance for rather critical applications that have stringent, often conflicting, property requirements. Steels for naval structural applications are subject to one of the harshest operating environments, with constant exposure to sea water, various types of static and dynamic loading, and large variation in temperatures. These steels are required to possess necessary ambient temperature strength (minimum yield strength: 390 to 800MPa for different variants) and excellent low temperature impact toughness (~ 80J minimum, at minus 40o C or even minus 60o C). Apart from these, they are also expected to have good weldability and adequate corrosion resistance. For over two decades, DMRL has been actively working in the development/indigenization of low alloy steels for naval applications with yield strengths of about 400MPa to about 800MPa, which are required to have impact toughness in excess of 80J at -40o C. Our efforts have spanned the entire spectrum from lab scale scientific studies to industrial scale production and certification for final use. Given the application, large sheets/plates, in widths ranging from 1.5 to 3m, and in lengths well in excess of 6m, constitute the bulk of the requirement. Thus, while studies at lab scale involve melts of 30-50kg, industrial production involves melts of 50 tonnes or more! The talk will provide a few examples from our work spanning the entire range from the developmental phase to the industrial production phase. Special emphasis will be given to illustrating how (lab-scale) R&amp;D was employed to address challenges that arose during bulk production in order to improve product reliability and consistency     ","categories": [],

Bacterial nanocellulose may prove to be one of the most promising green materials of modern times due to its advantages over plant cellulose, including high purity, good water absorption, strong water retention, high tensile strength, good biocompatibility and biodegradability Based on these characteristics, BNC has been widely used in many areas such as electronics, biomedicine, food industry and energy storage. It is also used in foods such as multifunctional food ingredients to control the properties of food or beverage as a thickener, stabilizer and texture modifier. In the biomedical field, BNC is widely studied as a highly biocompatible raw material for wound healing, artificial blood vessels, and tissue engineering. We have demonstrate by using indigenously isolated an alternative bacterium different than model organisms.

Abstract  Microstructures of materials are known to play a significant role in determining the effective properties of materials as well as their elasto-plastic response in terms of the ability to deform plastically to large strains without the onset of plastic instability and fracture. This has significance in terms of better understanding of material behavior of existing commercial alloys leading to their microstructure optimization as well as development of new alloys. Much experimental effort is being made towards developing techniques that are newer, faster, more accurate, and involve larger material volumes at smaller scales of precipitates and other constituent particles in the matrix. Additional effort is being made towards creating virtual microstructures that can efficiently and closely resemble real microstructures using statistical methods and stereological relationships. Lastly, microstructure-based finite element methodologies are being advanced to study large plastic deformation behavior of structural metallic materials for automotive forming applications. The talk would briefly review the smaller-scale particle characterization effort for structural metallic materials in the literature and then focus on the effort being made at McMaster towards (i) particle characterization of two different automotive aluminum sheet materials by statistical and FIB/SEM based experimental methods, and (ii) incorporation of particles microstructure into finite element models for studying their role in governing plastic flow, damage development, and fracture.

An aging global population is accelerating the need for better, longer-lasting implants. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to fabricate patient-specific, titanium-alloy-based implants with tailored, three-dimensional, bone-like pores and internal surfaces for forming new bone for superior integration. However, a stubborn barrier remains. Most of the implants developed by additive manufacturing technologies involve melting the materials by high energy beam, thereby increasing the operational cost for maintaining inert environment especially with reactive metals like titanium, magnesium and their alloys. In this talk, I will cover two stories, firstly, green fabrication, one the best alternative routes as there are absence of significant thermal gradients and associated stresses during printing, avoidance of solidification-induced defects, lower oxygen contamination, and lower printing cost. The second part, I will discuss the methods to improve interfacial bonding of the implants. Current line-of-sight clinical methods enhance osseointegration but can’t reach all internal surfaces of porous implants. I will present a non-line-of-sight, gas/solid-reaction-based process that is capable of generating well-controlled nanotopographies on all open (gasexposed) surfaces of these implants. Overall, this research will demonstrate simple, user friendly and cost-effective route for developing titanium implants/equivalents with enhanced interfacial bonding for load bearing functional implant applications.

Annamalai   Australian Institute for Bioengineering &amp; Nanotechnology,   The University of Queensland,    St Lucia, Queensland,    Australia, 4072    When?  3rd December, 2021 (Friday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Nanocellulose is a versatile functional nanomaterial, and it can be derived from all the lignocellulose biomass, marine animals and through bacterial engineering. It has a potential to be utilised in plethora of advance engineering applications, from both the sustainability perspectives (economy, environment and society) and new functionalities that can offer. In 2012, we have discovered that a long and thin nanofibres can be isolated from an Australian native arid grass spinifex and found that this nanocellulose can retain the cell wall constituents hemicellulose and lignin. This results in effortless fibrillation, and consequently, the cost-effective production of excellent longer and more flexible nanofibres. This unique combination opens an opportunity for tunability in residual lignocellulosic composition, morphology and the physical and mechanical properties with high product yield, through various chemical pre-treatments and surface modifications. Since the discovery, we have explored the use of spinifex nanocellulose in various applications for various industry sectors and found some limitations and challenges. This presentation will give an overview of our team’s translational research activities in clever applications including ultrathin dipped elastomer products, polymer composites, recycling papers and cementitious materials.   The presentation will also be extended on the strategies for improving sustainability and performance of rigid polyurethane foam for insulation applications, which is the research area I developed at UQ. Insulation is a cost-effective solution for saving energy in in space conditioning and appliances applications, is the need for the hour and rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) based insulation materials have gained an increased attention for their versatility, processibility and achievable physical properties (high compressive strength, low thermal conductivity) at low-density regime. Our research focuses on achieving sustainability and performance of RPUF insulation materials through systematic incorporation of biomass-derived precursors and nanomaterial additives. The presentation will demonstrate different strategies of thermal insulation and mechanical performance using palm oil (as a reactive polyol) and rod-like cellulose nanocrystals (CNC as nucleating agent), and an industrial grade lignin (as a reactive filler).

We continually interact with computational, memory, and imaging devices where a large number of electrons are pushed around various defect states at every nanosecond inside semiconductors. As these technologies are evolving rapidly from traditional circuit boards to flexible electronics, new materials, physics, and processing technologies are being explored to improve their functionality and efficiency. This brings unique experimental challenges to evaluate fundamentally the interaction of defects with electrons in novel semiconducting materials. In this presentation, I will first discuss a prototypical MIS capacitive device architecture to illustrate the electron trapping in non-volatile memory devices fabricated using low temperature processed oxide material. Unlike the conventional measurement technique, I will then describe the challenges in measuring the defects in non-conventional semiconductor materials and my approach of probing defects. In the later part, I will demonstrate a high-speed capacitance measurement system to probe the defect states in solution processed oxide materials. Finally, I will explain the major advantage of this measurement system in terms of eliminating the contribution of substrate or interface defect states. Thus new measurement system paves the way for characterizing the semiconductor materials for industrial applications.   ","categories": [],

In this regard, thermoelectric materials and devices have drawn increasing interest and attention due to their potential to convert waste heat into fruitful electricity. [1] A dimensionless figure of merit quantifies the thermoelectric material’s efficiency, zT = S 2σT/k where S, σ, T and k are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature and total thermal conductivity (sum of the electronic part, ke and the lattice part, klatt) respectively. The fact that these thermoelectric transport properties are highly interrelated throws a more significant challenge in enhancing zT. However, advances in recent times show that it is feasible to improve zT by a number of approaches: electronic band convergence, fostering resonance states near the Fermi level, quantum confinement of charge carriers, nestification, electron filtering effect, dimensionality reduction, modulating light bands with a low effective mass, deformation potential coefficient, and nanostructuring, which includes the engineering of nanoscale defects (dislocations, stacking faults, point defects, and nanopores), and multiscale hierarchical architecting, imparting rattling impurities, intrinsic bond/strong lattice anharmonicities, etc.[2] The presentation shall highlight some of these approaches that we have effectively applied on various kinds of materials, ranging from glasses and ceramics to several types of polycrystalline compounds (materials based on tellurides, sulfides, and oxides); different synthesis and processing techniques, right from traditional melt processing to advanced flash-spark plasma sintering; distinct approaches like dopant induced glass crystallization, composition engineering, nanostructuring, electronic band structure engineering, lattice softening, etc., to enhance the thermoelectric performance.[3–8] The presentation shall also touch upon our attempts to find thermoelectric materials for potential application at different operating ranges of temperature.

To control the performance of 2D materials, many methods have been proposed, including physical and chemical ways, to manipulate the electronic, atomic, and microscopic properties.

Recently, the earth-abundant semiconductor materials (binary, ternary and quaternary) have drawn major interests as viable candidate to boost the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells. Effective commercialization of solar cells hinges on the low-cost scaled up synthesis approaches along with cost-effective device fabrication techniques. Earth-abundant semiconductor materials have shown a great potential for these synthesis methods and the thin-film technology with portable deposition techniques has proven to be the most cost-effective route for solar cell fabrication. These materials have attracted substantial attention due to their non-toxicity, low-cost potential, direct band gap commensurate with optical absorption in the visible range and high absorption coefficient (&gt;104 cm-1). Thorough atomic-level insights about the fundamental properties of the interfaces and mechanisms underlying the interfacial phenomena are immensely desirable, which aids in the fabrication of high-quality and structurally ordered junctions for efficient photovoltaic applications. The understanding about the band alignment and the related properties at the interfaces is of paramount importance as it directly affects the device performance. Several of our recent studies focused on band alignment engineering for a clear understanding of the concurrent carrier transport mechanism at heterointerface. The facile synthesis, cost-effective deposition, and fundamental insights about the band-alignment provide a promising approach for fabrication of next-generation solar cells with earth-abundant light-absorbing materials.

However, high processing/annealing temperature (≥600°C) involved in the fabrication of thin/thick films causes the electrical breakdown of the films and also prevents their deposition on flexible, and metallic substrates. The thin/thick films of ferroelectrics at lower temperatures can be fabricated by (1) laser-induced crystallization (LIC) technique using an excimer laser (&lt;300oC) (2) aerosol deposition (AD) method at room temperature and (3) photon-assisted flash annealing technique. We have successfully demonstrated a way to crystallize Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (BST) thin films at a lower temperature of ~300°C by an alternating depositing and annealing process using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. At first, the BST thin film with a thickness of ~120 nm was deposited (laser energy of ~2 J/cm2) and subsequently laser annealed (66 mJ/cm2) at 300°C with several repetitions. Similarly, the aerosol deposition (AD) technique was employed to fabricate the thick films of PLZT ceramics (relaxor and anti-ferroelectric) at room temperature. The grain sizes of the AD thick films were tuned by thermal annealing which in turn can tune the electrical properties. The PLZT AD thick films showed excellent energy-storage density with stable energy efficiency which is required for commercial applications. Recently, photonics-based annealing using a xenon flash lamp has been successfully demonstrated for the annealing of metal oxide films on metal or polymer substrates fabricated by using PLD and AD. This photon-assisted flash annealing technique can be employed to realize flexible triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators, magneto-mechano-electric (MME) generators, magnetic field sensors, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS), and micro-actuators.

Group,  Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Metrology (CAMM),  CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute   &amp;    Associate Professor, AcSIR (CMERI campus)   When?  20th December, 2021 (Monday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Those who are unable to attend the meeting at lecture theatre, can attend the same using the below Teams link.   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  1. Semi solid casting of Al alloys and Al matrix composites to develop prototype Automobile components    Semi solid casting (employing gravity and pressure die casting techniques) enables manufacturing of near net shaped automobile, aircraft and marine components with better mechanical and tribological properties and with better dimensional accuracy. Better strength to weight ratio of semi solid cast Aluminium alloy and Aluminium matrix composite based auto components causes reduced fuel consumption and reduced green house gas emission.  The present work discusses the development of process technology of Rheo pressure die casting (RPDC) and Rheo gravity die casting (RGDC) of Al alloys and Al matrix composites. In case of RPDC, A cooling slope made of stainless steel has been employed for semi solid slurry generation, followed by isothermal holding of the generated slurry in a resistance heating furnace and transferring it in metered quantity to the shot sleeve of high pressure die casting machine, to develop automotive knuckle housing (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra) as a prototype component out of A356 Al alloy. Whereas, Rheo gravity die casting process technology has been employed to develop light weight automobile components out of in-house developed novel Al-15Mg2Si-4.5Si composite with notably improved mechanical properties and structural integrity. Automobile Brake disc (Tata Indica) has been developed as a prototype component out of the above mentioned composite. Thereafter, the developed composite is processed using a high pressure die casting machine at liquid and semi solid state to develop prototype connecting rod (TVS), targeting two wheeler engine applications.   2. Design and Development of Tooth colored dental (Orthodontic) brackets    Dental brackets, scientifically known as orthodontic brackets, are used for correction of irregular and deformable teeth of the people by applying continuous pressure on the teeth to slowly move the teeth in a specific direction over a period of time, which helps to make proper teeth alignment. Out of the options available, ceramic brackets offer significantly better mechanical properties, increased transparency and decreased reactivity with the oral environment compared to their metallic and plastic counterparts.  In spite of costlier translucent alumina (ceramic) dental brackets available in the market, which are imported in our country, in the present work, affordable net shape Tooth coloured alumina dental brackets have been developed for a comparable cost with their metallic counterparts, employing Micro Ceramic Injection Moulding (µ-CIM) process technology, for the first time in the country. It should be noted here that, apart from processing technique, the novelty lies in the design aspect as well. Design modifications are incorporated within the developed brackets, in view of ease of manufacturing and to achieve cost efficiency. The developed brackets are found to be of low cost, tooth colored appearance, possessing improved hardness, bio compatibility and improved debonding strength. The above mentioned attributes qualifies their suitability for possible societal deployment.   ","categories": [],

RANGANATHAN Distinguished Lecture Series”   About Prof. S. Ranganathan:  Professor Srinivasa Ranganathan is the NASI Platinum Jubilee Fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore . His academic career as an educator and researcher in metallurgy at Banaras Hindu University and the Indian Institute of Science during the last four decades has been exceptional. He has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure of interfaces, quasicrystals, bulk metallic glasses, and nanostructured materials. He has co-authored three books with Alan Mackay and Eric Lord on New Geometries for New Materials, Legendary Wootz Steel with Sharada Srinivasan, and high-entropy alloys with Profs. B.S. Murty and Yeh. He worked together with metallurgical legends such as Professor T.R. Anantharaman, Prof. Alan Cottrell, and Prof Gareth Thomas. This had a profound influence on not just his life, but also on the subject of multicomponent alloys. “The search for structure continues, and I mainly rely on geometric intuition. I visited higher-dimensional space. In archaeo- metallurgy, I traveled back in time to distant lands in antiquity.”, he says in his article on “A search for structure with travels in space and time.” He is a teacher par excellence and has inspired students throughout his teaching career and changed the life of every student, who came in contact with him.   Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. J.W. Yeh  NTHU, Taiwan   When?  10th January, 2022 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Since ancient times, there has been an unbreakable myth in the manufacture of materials: it is believed that adding more kinds of alloying elements in high proportions would render the alloy brittle and useless. To break the myth, “high-entropy alloys” was proposed in 2004 and defined as having at least five major elements. The name emphasized the high entropy effect which enhances multi-principal elements in a composition to form solid solutions. Severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion and cocktail effects also accompany the alloy by affecting microstructure and properties. Now, the high entropy composition concept has been extended to ceramics, polymers and organics. Medium-entropy materials are also activated and researched. Therefore, the elemental periodic table has a new life providing unlimited compositions and properties. This talk briefly summarizes the four core effects and describes the applied technology of high- entropy materials in industry.   About the Speaker:  Prof. J.W. Yeh is a Distinguished Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. He is the first to propose the concept of HEAs and HE-related materials. He has been researching this topic for almost 19 years. From 2004 until the present, he has published more than 240 SCI papers, including at least 180 on high-entropy materials. He defined and named the new alloys; proposed four fundamental effects and established fundamental principles; extended the concept to ceramics and polymers; and paved the way for newcomers by demonstrating the feasibility, phenomena, and potential of high-entropy materials via casting, wrought, powder metallurgy, and coating routes. At ICHEM-2018, the conference’s steering committee elected him Chair of the International High Entropy Materials Consortium. Additionally, he has over 25,760 citations and an H-index of 69. (Web of science). Additionally, he holds at least 40 patents.  ","categories": [],

It is found that an increase in the Cr/Ni ratio stabilizes the topologically close-packed σ-phase and accelerates its precipitation kinetics [4], which is also enhanced by a decrease in mean grain size. By analyzing the temporal evolutions of the concentration profiles forming at FCC/σ interfaces and the dimensions of σ-phase precipitates, the diffusion processes responsible for the precipitation kinetics were identified [5]. As the σ-phase is known to cause embrittlement in austenitic alloys, its influence on tensile properties was investigated. Overall, this work not only sheds light on the factors affecting the long-term stability of HEAs from the Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni system and the precipitation kinetics of secondary phases, but it also motivates the investigation of other HEAs that are considered for applications at high temperatures.

However, it was only in the last five decades that the science of sintering was perfected. More recently, the addition of electric field-assisted sintering has led to ultrafast sintering and achieving improved properties compared to conventional sintering. In this subset of sintering processes, flash-sintering has emerged as a rather distinctive processing route due to the simplicity of the process and flexibility in scale-up. While the scientific engagement of flash sintering saw an exponential increase in the last few years, it is now being applied to processes beyond sintering. These include reactive flash-sintering, where two components are co-flashed to result in a non-equilibrium phase stabilization, the touch-free sintering, where the boundaries of electricity-induced sintering are pushed towards complex shape sintering, and the possibility of graphene infusion by flash, to name a few states of art developments in the flash. It’s speculated that most, if not all, of these distinctive properties are possible due to the existence of a solid-state plasma during the Stage III of the flash. I am looking forward to discussing these developments with you in the upcoming talk.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Vikram Gavini  Department of Mechanical Engineering,  Department of Materials Science and Engineering,  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor   When?  12th April, 2022 (Tuesday), 10:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  Electronic structure calculations, especially those using density functional theory (DFT), have been very useful in understanding and predicting a wide range of materials properties. The importance of DFT calculations to engineering and physical sciences is evident from the fact that ~20% of computational resources on some of the world’s largest public supercomputers are devoted to DFT calculations. Despite the wide adoption of DFT, and the tremendous progress in theory and numerical methods over the decades, the following challenges remain. Firstly, the state-of-the-art implementations of DFT suffer from cell-size and geometry limitations, with the widely used codes in solid state physics being limited to periodic geometries and typical simulation domains containing a few hundred atoms. This limits the complexity of materials systems that can be treated using DFT calculations. Secondly, there are many materials systems (such as strongly-correlated systems) for which the widely used model exchange-correlation functionals in DFT, which account for the many-body quantum mechanical interactions between electrons, are not satisfactory. Addressing these challenges will enable large-scale quantum-accuracy DFT calculations, and can significantly advance our ab initio modeling capabilities to treat complex materials systems.   This talk will discuss our recent advances towards addressing the aforementioned challenges. In particular, the development of computational methods and numerical algorithms for conducting fast and accurate large-scale DFT calculations using adaptive finite-element discretization will be presented, which form the basis for the open-source DFT-FE code. The computational efficiency, scalability and performance of DFT-FE will be presented, which demonstrates a significant outperformance of widely used plane-wave DFT codes. Some recent studies that highlight the capabilities of DFT-FE will be presented, which include: (i) studies on dislocation energetics in Magnesium; (ii) understanding the electronic structure underpinnings of electron transport in DNA molecules. In addressing the second challenge, our recent breakthrough in accurately solving the inverse DFT problem will be presented, which has enabled the computation of exact exchange-correlation potentials for polyatomic systems. Ongoing efforts on using the exact exchange-correlation potentials to develop a data-driven approach for improving the exchange-correlation functional description in DFT will be discussed.

Constitutive models for the flow strength as a function of strain, strain rate, pressure, and temperature are needed to model and simulate applications. This talk focuses on the behavior of iron at high strain rates using a split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar (SHPB) and at high pressures using the pressure shear plate impact (PSPI) technique. A shear-compression specimen (SCS) used to attain high strain rates, large strains, and shear dominant deformation provides a seamless characterization of a-iron over a range of strain rates, 10-4 to 2x104 s-1. In addition to the mechanical response (stress-strain), a high-speed infrared detector is used to measure in-situ temperature rise during dynamic deformation. Strong strain rate sensitivity of flow stress is observed, with strengths exceeding 1 GPa, comparable to pre-shocked iron and high strength steels. The microstructural evolution characterized using optical, SEM, TEM, and EBSD provides insights into the strengthening and deformation mechanisms.  Results from PSPI experiments on iron at pressures ranging from 10 to 43 GPa and strain rates ~105 s-1 are presented. The mechanical response of the low pressure a phase (bcc) and the high-pressure e phase (hcp) is obtained, with the a to e transformation occurring at ~13 GPa. A strong pressure hardening in strength is observed, and the possible mechanisms for the hardening are discussed.   ","categories": [],

She did her B.S. from the department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, METU (Ankara, Turkey). Thereafter, she received her PhD. from the Iowa state University (AMES lab), in Materials Science and Engineering, followed by a post-doc at CNRS - UPMC, Paris Nanoscience Institute (INSP), Paris, FRANCE, where she worked on a project with the French space agency. Prof. Serofoglu experience lies in conducting controlled in-situ solidification experiments and studying spontaneous pattern formation/microstructure evolution in multi-phase systems.   When?  27th April, 2022 (Wednesday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Mode  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The cooperative or diffusively coupled growth of multiple phases during solidification is one of the most widely observed and generally important classes of phase transformations in materials. Technologically, due to having lower melting points compared with their pure components, and small freezing ranges, these alloys have excellent fluidity exhibited during casting and favorable properties offered by the fine composite structures both of which contribute to the wide application of eutectic alloys in the casting, welding, soldering, and additive manufacturing of engineered components. Academically, the topic of eutectic solidification offers a wealth of rich problems involving multicomponent thermodynamics, solid-liquid and solid-solid interfacial phenomena, morphological stability, chemical and thermal diffusion, and nucleation phenomena. Surprisingly, despite the broad-based technological and academic importance, many fundamental questions regarding eutectic solidification remain unanswered. This lack of understanding severely limits our ability to employ computational methods in the prediction of microstructure for the effective design of new materials and processing techniques through simulation.   In this study, we address critical questions regarding microstructure selection in three-phase eutectic systems in the presence of crystal/crystal anisotropy. Real-time directional solidification and rotating directional solidification experiments were performed on In-Bi-Sn model alloy to characterize different grain types in three-phase systems. It is shown that while lamellar ABAC pattern is preserved during RDS of an isotropic eutectic grain, both the phase arrangement and the morphologies of phases could be altered in the presence of interphase boundary anisotropy. Diverse classes of three-phase eutectic grains are identified and analyzed. It is shown that the formation of these grains is a function of the intrinsic properties of the interphase boundaries, rather than experimental parameters. The equilibrium shapes of the interphase boundaries are experimentally determined and consequently, the corresponding γ- plots of the interphase boundaries are constructed. These results are significant not only for the materials science community but also for the out of equilibrium pattern formation dynamics branch of nonlinear physics.  ","categories": [],

He then moved to McGill University (Montreal, Canada) to earn his Master’s degree in mechanical engineering, where he worked on laser transmission welding of thermoplastic composites using laser refraction. He then earned his PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Northwestern University (USA) on the topic: Deformation and failure in metallic nanowires under stress-relaxation, cyclic and high strain rate loading conditions. Further, he joined Empa – Swiss federal laboratories for materials science and technology, Switzerland as a Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellow to research on high strain rate testing of microscale materials at extreme temperatures and templated electrodeposition based micromanufacturing. In August 2020, he joinedMax-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung (Germany) as Group Leader of Nanomechanical instrumentation and extreme nanomechanics (XNano) group, which focuses on developing testing platforms and the necessary protocols/methods to conduct nano-to-meso scale mechanical testing under extreme strain rates/ temperatures and localized electrodeposition-based 3D printing of metallic micro/nano architectures.

The field of macroscale dynamic testing was established in the 1940’s specifically for assessing the mechanical behavior of materials under extreme strain rates. But given the push towards miniaturization, micro and nano scale parts have recently become ubiquitous and functional parts in a variety of applications. As such, small scale mechanics has been a topic of intense research over the last two decades. However, to date the micro and nanomechanical experiments have been limited to quasi-static testing speeds and the behavior of small-scale materials under extreme strain rates remains largely unexplored experimentally. In this presentation, I will introduce testing platforms required to conduct micro and nano-scale mechanical metrology at high strain rates. Specifically, I will present a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based nanomechanical testing platform capable of performing high strain rate testing, along with a case study on single crystalline silver nanowires. In the second part of my talk, I will introduce a localized electrodeposition-based additive micromanufacturing (AMM) technique capable of fabricating full-metal 3D micro/nano architectures. Subsequently, case studies on the dynamic mechanical characterization of copper micropillars and microlattices built using AMM, along with complementary microstructural characterization will be presented.

Over the past decade, we integrated the high-speed X-ray imaging capabilities present at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 32 ID-B (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA) with the high-rate loading offered by the Kolsky compression/tension bar and light gas gun. High-speed X-ray images and X-ray diffraction can be obtained simultaneously. The effectiveness of these new experimental capabilities is verified via impact on various material systems, demonstrating in-situ image analysis inside of the material systems during loading rates commonly encountered in high-rate deformation environments, such as high-speed machining, vehicle collision, and blast/impact.

When?  8th June, 2022 (Wednusday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  A key design consideration in flexible electronics, particularly for wearables and sensing applications, is low voltage, low power operation. This requirement not only serves to maximise battery lifetime but crucially ensures operational stability of thin film transistor (TFT) circuits and systems. Ultralow voltage/current operation is especially important in sensor interfaces so as to achieve a high resolution of the sensory signal. This presentation will review the TFT design and materials selection strategies for ultralow power operation. We examine the main issues that lead to a high operating voltage of the TFT, and discuss processing conditions for suppressing the interface trap density. Recent advances in low-voltage thin-film transistors show it is possible for the subthreshold slope to approach the thermionic limit, q/kT. Based on these considerations, an all-inkjet-printed ultra-low-power high-gain amplifier, applied to eye movement tracking by detecting human electrooculogram signals, is presented.

In 2012, Prof. Zhong-Lin Wang and co-workers at Georgia Tech reported the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a new source of energy, which basically works on the principle of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction. The TENG can be assembled within a few minutes using off-the-shelf materials and used for harvesting mechanical energy from the environment which is otherwise wasted. The TENG has a very simple working mechanism, and simple design, and can be used to power many small wearable electronics. A few examples of TENGs devised at the Clemson Nanomaterials Institute will be presented.   A thermoelectric generator (TEG) converts waste heat into usable energy. The TEGs are emerging as viable renewable energy sources, which directly convert the waste heat into electricity. The efficiency of a TEG is related to its figure-of-merit ZT= S2s/k, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, s and k are the electrical and thermal conductivities, respectively. The inherent challenges for increasing ZT will be discussed, and the use of Raman spectroscopy as a facile tool to quantify anharmonicity in thermoelectric materials will be presented.

When?  06th July, 2022 (Wednesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  We in situ observe the ultrafast dynamics of trapped carriers in organic methyl ammonium lead halide perovskite thin films by ultrafast photocurrent spectroscopy with a sub-25 picosecond time resolution. Upon ultrafast laser excitation, trapped carriers follow a phonon-assisted tunneling mechanism and a hopping transport mechanism along ultra-shallow to shallow trap states ranging from 1.72-11.51 millielectronvolts and are demonstrated by time-dependent and independent activation energies. In addition to carrier mobility of ~ 4 cm2/V.s and lifetime of ~ 1 nanosecond, we validate the above transport mechanisms by highlighting trap state dynamics, including trapping rates, de-trapping rates, and trap properties such as trap density, trap levels, and capture-cross sections. This work [1] establishes a foundation for trap dynamics in high defect-tolerant perovskites with ultra-fast temporal and ultra-high energy resolution.   [1] Nature Communications, 12 (2021).

When?  26th July, 2022 (Wednesday), 12:01 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Department of Materials Engineering, KPA auditorium   Abstract  Zirconium-alloys have been used successfully as materials for light water reactor (LWR) fuel cladding (tubes that contain uranium-dioxide fuel pellets) for many decades because of their excellent neutron transparency, and good strength and hydrothermal corrosion resistance under normal operating conditions. However, in the rare event of loss of active cooling, decay heat can rapidly increase the temperature of the Zr-alloy cladding. This can result in severe oxidation of Zr-alloy in reaction with steam and loss of mechanical integrity of the cladding. This was unfortunately the case in the Fukushima-Daiichi accident in Japan in 2011. A near-term approach to increase coping time in such events is to coat the Zr-alloy cladding with an oxidation-resistant material.  In this presentation I will discuss our research on the development of the cold spray process for the deposition of oxidation-resistant materials on Zr-alloy cladding, with emphasis on Cr coatings. In cold spray, powder of the coating material is propelled at supersonic velocities on to the surface of a substrate to form a coating. The particle temperature is low and coating forms in solid-phase due to high strain-rate deformation of the particles upon impact with the substrate, and an associated adiabatic shear process. Results of this developmental study, including the performance of these coatings in steam environments up to 1300 oC will be presented. In situ examination of radiation damage in a TEM showed lower defect evolution kinetics in the cold spray Cr coatings compared to a reference bulk annealed Cr. It is noted that other materials and/or coating technologies are being investigated for this application and the ultimate implementation of the coated cladding concept will be decided by various stakeholders in industry and governmental agencies.

She is currently a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University (Finland), working in the area of battery recycling. Previously, She completed my PhD from McMaster University (Canada), worked on slag/metal reaction kinetics in oxygen steelmaking process. She had also experienced on application of machine learning in process data while working at TRDDC for 2.5 years. She did my masters (M.Tech.) from IIT Bombay and bachelors (B.E.) from Jadavpur University.   When?  2nd November, 2022 (Wednesday), 03:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  ‘Bloating’ i.e. swelling of droplets is an important phenomenon in oxygen steelmaking process which determines the overall process efficiency by influencing the kinetics of refining. This phenomenon is controlled mainly by decarburization reaction kinetics. In this work, a mathematical model for decarburization of a droplet was developed incorporating all kinetic steps. This model demonstrated remarkably well performance with variation of experimental parameters and specifically with conditions similar to oxygen steelmaking. Another finding from this work was development of a novel kinetic model to incorporate slag electrical conductivity effect into analysis which is generally ignored by process metallurgist for decades despite knowing the nature of the system. Battery Recycling Extraction of cobalt from secondary resources has become crucial as it has been identified as strategically important and a critical raw material due to the high risks of supply chain disruptions. In this work, selective sulfation roasting followed by water leaching was investigated as a potential recycling strategy to extract cobalt and lithium from industrial LCO-rich black mass. Specifically, the effect of graphite on metals extraction was studied. A selective extraction efficiency of 99.5% Li and 60% Co by was obtained by this route.   ","categories": [],

A crucial route to achieve sustainable energy resources that are efficient and economically viable is by fine tuning the performance of materials with appropriate structure and properties. Computational thermodynamics is a powerful tool for designing new materials as well as modifying the structure and properties of existing materials for an intended application. This talk will demonstrate how thermodynamic and kinetic simulations can be employed for the design of materials for sustainable use of existing energy resources, with two case studies. In the first case study, the application of CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) method to optimize the Gibbs energy functions for all the phases in a multicomponent chloride salt system which is important for nuclear fuel reprocessing and thermodynamic calculations to predict the critical properties using the developed database will be discussed. In the second case study, the design of a graded transition interlayer using high-throughput CALPHAD computations for joining dissimilar materials that are commonly employed in advanced ultra-supercritical power plants as well as application of diffusion and Scheil simulations for determining the location-specific solidification cracking susceptibility of graded alloys will be presented.

When?  11th November, 2022 (Friday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  KPA Auditorium   Abstract  Non-wetting surfaces can be useful in several sectors such as marine, biomedical, paint, food industries etc. They are primarily prepared by mimicking natural surfaces such as Lotus leaves, Shark skin, bird feathers, flower petals, Nepenthes Pitcher Plant etc. Typically, the surface chemistries and surface topologies are carefully controlled to tailor the surface wettability. Globally, researchers are focusing on the fabrication of novel non-wetting surfaces to achieve anti-frosting, anti-icing, anti- bacterial surfaces etc. However, most of them have utilized protruding (positive) textures or simply untextured (referred to as flat) surfaces. In this talk, the emphasis will be given to compare the performance of dimples (negative) on the non-wetting properties with that of the positive textures and untextured surfaces. For this, the silicone oil coated textured PDMS surfaces are employed. The static contact angles, dynamic contact angles and slide-off angles of water drops were measured as a function of oil film thickness and thermodynamic models were adapted to explain the observations. Also, the shear drainage of the lubricant and the normal adhesion of the water drops atop these positively textured, negatively textured and flat, oil coated surfaces were quantitatively measured. They reveal that the negative textures outperform the positive textures and flat surfaces. Additionally, these textures have shown high promise in terms of lubricant retention in submerged sea-water flowing conditions as tested up to 7 days. Further, the use of non-wetting surfaces for sanitation applications, marine applications and food industries will be discussed briefly.  ","categories": [],

The overarching challenge is to design alloys that are compatible with the unique additive processing conditions while maintaining material properties sufficient for the challenging environments encountered in energy, space, and nuclear applications. Here we describe a new class of high strength 3D printable superalloys containing approximately equal parts of Co and Ni along with Al, Cr, Ta and W that possess strengths in excess of 1.1 GPa in as-printed and post-processed forms and tensile ductilities of greater than 13 % at room temperature. These alloys are amenable to crack-free 3D printing via electron beam melting (EBM) with preheat as well as selective laser melting (SLM) with limited preheat. The status of computational and experimental design tools that have guided compositional development will be described.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr Daniel B. Miracle  Senior Scientist,  Materials and Manufacturing Directorate  Air Force Research Laboratory  Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45324    When?  06th December, 2022 (Tuesday), 11:30 AM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The influence of temperature on strength in BCC metals and alloys is not simple. Thermally-dependent regions are seen at both low and high temperatures where strength drops quickly with increasing temperature, and an intermediate plateau region is usually seen between them where strength is relatively insensitive to temperature. Together, the complex (three or more principal elements) and concentrated (principal elements of at least 5-10 at. % each) nature of refractory complex, concentrated alloys (RCCAs) may introduce important differences in deformation and strengthening mechanisms compared to BCC elements and dilute BCC alloys. For example, the relative mobility of screw and edge dislocations may be much different in some RCCAs compared to traditional BCC materials, and new models have been needed to accurately predict strength. Early datasets were insufficient to scope the thermal dependence of strength in RCCAs broadly as a class of materials, but increasing availability of data now make such a study feasible. The objective of this work is to answer the question, “is the temperature dependence of strength similar or different for RCCAs as a class of materials compared to BCC elements and conventional, dilute BCC alloys?” To answer this question, we evaluate strength vs. temperature by curating and analyzing a large dataset of results collected from the literature. This dataset includes stress vs temperature for 68 distinct RCCAs, six refractory elements, and six conventional (usually dilute) refractory alloys. Both single-phase and multi-phase RCCAs are included in the dataset and are analyzed separately. We evaluate the transition temperatures between the thermally-dependent and plateau regimes for RCCAs and compare to refractory elements and commercial alloys. The rate at which stress degrades with temperature is also evaluated, especially within the intermediate temperature regime. From this work, general features and trends for the temperature-dependent strength of RCCAs are established and described.   ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. Shankha Nag   PostDoctoral Researcher, Material Modeling Division,   Institute for Materials Science, Technical University Darmstadt, Germany.    About the Speaker:  Dr. Shankha Nag earned his Bachelor degree in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from National Institute of Technology Durgapur (India) in 2013 and his Master degree in Materials Engineering from Indian Institute of Science Bangalore in 2015. After graduation, Dr. Nag pursued his doctoral study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) in the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling, supervised by Prof. William Curtin. At EPFL, Dr. Nag developed new methods for accurate atomistic-continuum coupling of random alloys. As part of his dissertation, he also developed a generalized solute-strengthening theory applicable to single-phase homogeneous alloys, where he considered the effect of chemical short-range order and solute-solute interactions across the slip plane. Dr. Nag obtained his doctorate degree from EPFL in November 2020, for successful completion of dissertation entitled “Concurrent multiscale modeling and theory of solute-strengthening for dilute and complex concentrated alloys”. Starting January 2021, Dr. Nag has been working as a postdoctoral researcher at Technical University in Darmstadt (Germany) in the Material Modeling Division, headed by Prof. Karsten Albe. As a part of his postdoctoral research, he has studied the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline high-entropy entropy alloys with low/negative stacking fault energy. He has also worked independently on developing a theory for nucleation of slip mediated planar defects. Dr. Nag’s research aims at the fundamental, multi-scale understanding (atomistic and continuum) of plasticity and phase transitions in metallic alloys, in order to develop predictive theories that can be used to guide materials design in uncharted regions of the material properties space.   When?  16th December, 2022 (Friday), 03:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Materials modeling using atomistic simulations (like molecular dynamics or MonteCarlo) has supplemented experiments in understanding key mechanisms behind macroscopic material behavior. However, the many degrees of freedom associated with these simulations coupled with practical limitations in simulation length and time scales, make it difficult to correlate complex physical phenomena like dislocation nucleation and glide to basic material parameters like elastic constants, stacking fault energy, etc. across different material systems. However, this goal can be realized with predictive theories which model underlying mechanisms in terms of basic material parameters and aid in efficiently combing through the vast space of material properties in search for new materials with enhanced performance. In this presentation, I will discuss theories, free of adjustable parameters, that address the long-standing problems of (1) solute-strengthening by pinning of dislocation segments in metallic alloys during glide [1, 2], and (2) homogeneous and heterogeneous dislocation nucleation. The solute-strengthening theory has been applied to dilute as well as complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) with remarkable success in predicting experimentally obtained yield strengths. In keeping with the recent surging interest in strengthening of alloys with short-range order (SRO), the strengthening theory has been extended to include the effects of SRO [3]. This generalized solutestrengthening theory is state of the art which is applicable to any macroscopically homogeneous and single-phase alloy, and the theory takes inputs that can be measured or computed. On the other hand, the theory for dislocation nucleation finds the minimum stress required to nucleate stable dislocation loop at rates below 0.01s −1 at different temperatures. The theory is applicable to deformation of metals and alloys with nanocrystalline microstructure and shear coupled grain boundary migration mediated by the nucleation and propagation of grain boundary disconnections.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Mr Anubhav Roy  PhD candidate  Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics  The Pennsylvania State University, USA    About the Speaker:  Anubhav Roy is a PhD candidate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at The Pennsylvania State University. He has been pursuing research in theoretical and computational mechanics under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Kube at the Penn State Ultrasonics Lab (PennSUL). Anubhav graduated from the Department of Construction Engineering, Jadavpur University (Kolkata, India) in 2016 where he had gained computational research experience in static nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of 1D structures (beams and trusses). During his undergraduate studies in India, Anubhav had worked 1 as an intern in some of the most prestigious research groups in different institutes, namely, IIT Kharagpur (2014), IIT Bombay (2015) and IISc Bangalore (2015). He received Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics from the University of Alabama (UA) in 2018 where he got the Outstanding Graduate Resarch Assistant award in the same year. At UA, he worked on capturing nano-scale fracture mechanisms by coupling Hardy estimates-based atomistic J-integral with Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations of isothermal (room temperature), uniaxial extention of defective Graphene sheets. Since joining Penn State, Anubhav has been involved in understanding mechanisms within the microstructure of polycrystalline materials. He received the Sabih and G¨uler Hayek graduate fellowship in Engineering Science and Mechanics in 2019 and 2020. Proposing a bottom-up research setup to facilitate an in situ, real time monitoring of structure-processing-properties of additively manufactured metals, Anubhav received the Best Poster Presentation award and a Travel Grant at the International Congress in Ultrasonics, organized at Belgium in 2019. Recently, in 2020 with Dr. Kube in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory, he developed a computational tool “propSym” that can efficiently reduce material property tensors corresponding to general order (rank) across all crystal point groups. As a continuation of the collaboration, he was a part of Dr. Kube’s research to develop the large acoustoelasticity theory for anisotropic materials, introducing a coupling between finite initial deformation and finite amplitude waves highlighting the influence of residual stress. Currently, Anubhav is working on elastodynamic modelling of ultrasonic scattering and attenuation in complex polycrystalline microstructure. He is one of the five recipients of the 2022 ASNT (American Society for Nondestructive Testing) Fellowship Award.   When?  20th December, 2022 (Tuesday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Venue  KPA Auditorium, Department of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Scattering of waves is an interesting phenomenon that spans length scales of planets down to the nanoscale. A scattered wave field carries important information about the medium of propagation, and is useful for a variety of fields in geophysics, seismology, radiology, material science, to name a few. Elastic wave scattering is commonly used as a sensitive tool for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and characterization of metallic microsctructure. Existing analytical models can predict ultrasonic propagation and grain boundary scattering in statistically homogeneous metals exhibiting spatially fluctuating mechanical properties. These models rely on two-point statistics that correspond to the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA) of the mass-operator series present in the governing Dyson equation. The use of the Dyson equation in elastodynamics enables us to apply Feynman diagrams and its rules to the mass operator to readily recover solutions for the effective propagation properties including wave displacements, dissipation, and scattering behavior. FOSA-based prediction agrees well with finite element (FE) results over a wide range of metals for using ultrasonic frequencies within stochastic limit. However, recent studies indicate a discrepancy between the predictions starts to grow for strongly scattering polycrystals. For polycrystals comprising grains of high single-crystal anisotropy, the reported discrepancy is about 63% for Lithium, even for low frequencies in the Rayleigh limit. In our current model, the third-order smoothing approximation (TOSA) based estimates of attenuation and wavespeed are analytically incorporated imposing long wavelength (Rayleigh-limit) assumptions. One of our broader interests includes investigating formal linkages between elastodynamic and elastostatic homogenization theories, such that elastic wave techniques can be used to probe structure-property relationships important for characterizing material behavior.   This presentation will focus on the development of the analytical model. The current TOSA-based model improves the existing longitudinal attenuation estimates for strongly scattering polycrystals comprised of grains with high single crystal aniostropy, like Lithium or Nickel by about 17% or 7% respectively. Furthermore, improvements for incorporating the current model are observed to be pronounced for the cases corresponding to transverse incidence. The improvement motivates further investigation to provide improved estimates especially for microsturctures exhibiting high scattering. The four point statistics based current model is expected to effectively improve the existing elastodynamic estimates of such complex microstructures, such as, in multi-phase (including porous) or textured media, etc.. Beyond applications to NDE of complex materials, the derivation of the current mathematical model may inspire future work in improving estimates for application in other disciplines like electrodynamics and quantum field theories that involve first-order homogenization of the Dyson equation to quantify strong-fluctuation of properties along space.

The novel initiative was formulated by Gouthama, presently a faculty member at IT Kanpur. Traditionally the aim, with which this event was envisaged, was to create a platform for the students of this department to interact by presenting and sharing their research amongst themselves. With time, and with the induction of undergraduates, this event has broadened to include the new members of this department, as well as try to familiarise its students with the research done elsewhere. This year, we take pride in ourselves by maintaining the legacy of this Annual Students’ Symposium for 36 years.   Message from Faculty Coordinators and Conveners  Times of festivity are times to be relished. For a person married to the technical way of life, there can be nothing more joyful than the moment when he can speak about his work to an appreciative audience. This is the moment for which he waits patiently, just like one waits for the arrival of a festive season. One such moment, for which the students of this department wait every year, is the Annual Students’ Symposium. Happening for the last 36 years, the aim of this symposium has been to present a platform for the research students of this department to interact, by presenting their ideas, amongst themselves. It also doubles up its responsibilities and enlightens the students about research taking place elsewhere through talks by dignitaries invited from various academies and industries. The 36th Annual Students’ Symposium will be held on 27th and 28th January, 2023. It gives us immense pleasure to be a part of the organising team of the students’ symposium. We hope the effort that we put in bears fruit through a successful conduction of the symposium, and may this symposium be a pleasurable moment for the students of the department as well.

These attributes make them candidate materials for aerospace and energy generation systems that require harsh operating conditions. The most popularly used high-temperature alloys are the Nickel-base superalloys, and among various Ni-base alloys, Inconel 718 (IN 718) is the most used material. The currently used superalloys are already exploited to very high operating temperatures near their solidus or the precipitate solvus temperatures. Any further increase in Carnot efficiency is only possible through design improvements and enhanced turbine cooling efficiency, which the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique can address. However, the adoption of AM processes for aerospace/mission-critical components is impeded due to microstructural heterogeneities and spontaneous defects observed in AM-produced parts. It is, therefore, necessary to develop processes that head to minimum porosity and design suitable heat treatments, and to evaluate the relevant mechanical properties post-heat treatment. A further approach could be to develop some new alloys that could be additively manufactured and exhibit the desirable properties.   The work carried out in the present thesis is aimed at addressing both these issues. In the first part of the thesis, attempts have been made to develop suitable heat treatments that would lead to desirable microstructures for tailoring relevant optimal mechanical properties that could render the material for the desired applications. Both the most commonly used routes of powder bed additive manufacturing have been used, namely the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and the Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Heat treatment schedules have been designed for both the so-obtained materials, and the microstructure, texture, and mechanical behavior of the as-built and heat-treated AM materials have been investigated. In the case of IN718, the specially designed heat treatment was aimed at optimizing the volume fraction of coherent and incoherent precipitates, and their role in the mechanical response has been explored in greater depth. In the second part, the present work will be substantiated with another class of high-temperature material, Ni-base eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA) AlCoCrFeNi2.1 has been produced by additive manufacturing which has shown better mechanical response than the conventional Ni-Al system. A comprehensive understanding of room and high temperature mechanical properties has been developed.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  A fundamental investigation of discrete liquid flow, gas and fines in a random packed bed, along with applications   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Govind S Gupta   When?  06th February, 2022 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  The liquid flow through a packed bed is quite common in many chemical engineering applications such as distillation, stripping, catalysis, and in metallurgical processes like blast furnace, heap leaching, etc. Many researchers have modelled the liquid flow in a packed bed using continuum hypothesis for both wetting and non-wetting conditions. However, from the physical observation made by various researchers, in a non-wetting or in a low liquid flow rate (heap leaching) system, it is found that the liquid flows not as a continuous stream but as a mixture of discrete rivulet(s) or droplet(s) or combination of both. The liquid flow in any direction, in a packed bed, depends on the local void shape and size. The deterministic approach to find out the void shape and size locally, is a big challenge which is lacking currently. Moreover, the effect of gas flow on the particles and liquid phase of the packed bed, taking into account the random nature of the bed and the discrete nature of the liquid, is lacking. The liquid flow in the presence of gas flow in a bed of particles is a common phenomenon in various metallurgical and chemical engineering processes. In the dripping zone of the blast furnace, where iron ore is converted to molten iron/slag (liquid), the liquid descends the coke bed in the form of droplets and rivulets. The hot blast of air injected laterally, along with the pulverized coal, from the tuyere region flows counter and cross-current to the liquid flow. A cavity, known as a raceway, is formed at the tuyere region due to the gas injection.   In the current study, the Discrete Liquid Flow (DLF) theory is used to model the liquid flow in a randomly packed bed where the shape and size of the void changes with location, The model considers the discrete nature of the flow taking into account the local non-uniformities of the packing. Random packing has been created using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The void size and shape are determined using a novel graph-based algorithm in the random 2D bed to study the liquid flow. The liquid flow behaviour has been studied in various conditions, like changing the packing size and bed height. This study confirms that the bed topology plays an important role in dictating the liquid flow behavior in a randomly packed bed.   The study is extended to heap leaching process, where the liquid flows as droplets and rivulets due to very low liquid flow rates. The liquid flow behaviour is studied in terms of tortuosity, liquid distribution, breakthrough time, contact angle etc. The study shows that heap leaching processes can be modelled more accurately using DLF theory by avoiding the uncertain experimental parameters (like bed permeability etc). The study shows that bed topology, the local velocity of the liquid, tortuosity, and liquid dispersion affect the distribution of the liquid and the amount of liquid in a heap packing.   Understanding the interaction of gas phase and solid particles of the packing is important before studying the interaction of gas-fines-particle-liquid phases in a packed bed. The study of solid flow has been carried out in presence of gas flow under the counter-current condition in the shaft based processes. Shaft based processes are used in many disciplines such as in metallurgical and chemical engineering. However, their performance suffers due to the lack in understanding of solid and gas flow thus the heat and mass transfer inside the shaft. A slow moving packed bed, inside the reactor, has been considered. Particles are discharged from the bottom and gas is injected laterally. The gas flow has been modelled using continuum-based fluid flow equations. The effect of various parameters (like particle size, gas flow rate, solid discharge rate etc.,) on the residence time of solid particles has been studied in detail. It is found that gas flow is not symmetric inside the reactor due to asymmetric distribution of voids.   Finally, the flow behaviour of the liquid phase in a random packed bed is studied, taking into account the movement of particles due to the lateral gas and fines injection. Gas and fines phase are modelled using continuum-based momentum conservation equations. The study shows that the cavity/raceway size increases due to the liquid injection. The deviation of the liquid path due to the gas and fines drag is also captured. It is found that the deviation of the liquid path is higher for the larger particle sizes.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Thesis title:  Concept of Intersecting Dissimilar Constrained Diffusion Paths for Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients in Multi Principal Element Alloys: Solving the Unsolved in Multicomponent Diffusion   Faculty advisor(s):  Prof. Aloke Paul   When?  24th February, 2022 (Friday), 03:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Where  KPA Auditorium, Dept of Materials Engineering   Abstract  Quantitative diffusion analysis in multicomponent metallic systems has been a formidable task historically despite decades of research. The in-depth studies were limited to interdiffusion, intrinsic diffusion coefficients mostly in binary systems and only interdiffusion coefficients in a few ternary systems until recently. The experimental complications associated with the need to intersect (𝑛−1) serpentine diffusion paths in the 𝑛 dimensional space led to unsolved problems and estimation of composition dependent diffusion coefficients was considered impossible until recently. The lack of diffusivity data in multicomponent systems has hampered the generation of mobility databases essential for microstructural simulation and correlation with various physical and mechanical properties of materials highlighting the performance and durability of the product.   The work first explores the additional advantages of practicing pseudo-binary (PB) and pseudo-ternary (PT) diffusion couple methods established recently in our laboratory. We demonstrate the importance of estimating tracer diffusion coefficients by proposing the augmented Darken-Manning correlations considering the vacancy wind effect. NiCoFeCr Multi Principal Element (MPE) system is considered as a model system for these analyses to compare the data estimated by the new methods proposed in this thesis with available radio tracer measurements. The contribution of vacancy wind effect is found to be very significant on certain cross intrinsic diffusion coefficients. Such analysis highlighting the role of vacancy wind effect was not reported earlier in multicomponent systems. The body diagonal method which was originally proposed for determination of interdiffusion coefficients only is extended in this thesis for determination of the tracer coefficients of all elements from only two diffusion profiles. This reduces the laborious task of producing (𝑛−1) diffusion paths within negligible but equal distances to each other. The requirement to produce (𝑛−1) diffusion paths passing within negligible distances to minimize errors as proposed in the original body diagonal method is often an impractical experimental target.   This work then explores the possibilities of intersecting dissimilar constrained diffusion paths. First, we demonstrate that intersecting a PT diffusion path with a PB diffusion path is easier and more precise compared to intersecting two similar PT diffusion paths. Further, we demonstrate that intersecting two dissimilar PT diffusion paths has the added benefits of estimation of diffusion coefficients of up to four elements. Following, we demonstrate that intersecting a conventional diffusion path in which all the elements produce the diffusion profiles with a rectilinear diffusion path of a PB couple is far easier for estimation of diffusion coefficient of all the elements in multicomponent system for any number of elements (𝑛≥3). This overcomes the limitations of all the methods demonstrated previously for estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the elements by intersecting only two diffusion paths at a desired composition. The equation scheme required for such analysis is established and described in detail.   Finally, a design strategy for intersecting the diffusion paths in Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Al multi-principal element alloy is demonstrated. This is guided by the possibilities of producing PB diffusion profiles in the NiCoFeCr system, This, for the first time, facilitates the estimation of the tracer, intrinsic, and interdiffusion coefficients of all the elements purely experimentally in this quinary system. The tracer diffusion coefficients estimated in this quinary system are compared with the impurity and tracer diffusion coefficients in pure Ni (taken from literature), and at (or near) equiatomic compositions of binary Ni-Co, ternary Ni-Co-Cr, and quaternary Ni-Co-Fe-Cr systems estimated in this study. The relative mobilities of the elements are found to follow the trend 𝐷𝑁𝑖∗&lt;𝐷𝐶𝑜∗&lt;𝐷𝐹𝑒∗&lt;𝐷𝐶𝑟∗&lt;𝐷𝐴𝑙∗ in all the systems.   However, the tracer diffusion coefficients of the elements first decrease and then increase with the increasing order of the systems. The contribution of the vacancy wind effect on certain cross-intrinsic diffusion coefficients is found to be very significant and cannot be ignored. The influence of the vacancy wind effect on interdiffusion coefficients is found to be less significant compared to the intrinsic diffusion coefficients since interdiffusion coefficients are a kind of average of multiple intrinsic diffusion coefficients. We have further shown that describing the relative diffusion rates of the elements with main interdiffusion coefficients instead of the tracer diffusion coefficients can be misleading or confusing. Consideration of different elements as the dependent variable of interdiffusion coefficients may indicate a very different or opposite trend.  ","categories": [],
