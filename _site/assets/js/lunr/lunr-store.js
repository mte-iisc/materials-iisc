Using first-principles theoretical analysis, we predict ferroelectricity in 2-D materials like 1T-MoS2 and h-NbN, and demonstrate how it originates from strongly coupled electrons and phonons. While these allow dipolectronic devices based on ultimately thin active channels, experimental realization of such devices and their scalable fabrication are quite challenging. To this end, we report scale-free ferroelectricity in which sub-nano meter thin ferroelectric layers are naturally embedded in 2-dimensional crystalline architecture of orthorhombic structure of HfO2, a material that is already a part of current semiconductor technologies, opening up ultimately high density ferroelectric memory devices.

        "title": "Materials Design: From Grain Boundary Mobilities to Additive Manufacturing  (09/02/21)",
        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. Peter Voorhees   Frank C. Engelhart  Professor of Materials Science and Engineering   Northwestern University  Illinois, USA    When?  9th February, 2021 (Tuesday), 08:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The classical method for designing materials to achieve certain performance goals involves a laborious procedure wherein intuition drives the design of a material that is then created and tested. In most cases, the performance goals are not achieved, and this costly procedure is repeated. By integrating data, computations, and artificial intelligence it is possible to break this expensive cycle and bring innovative new materials to the marketplace faster and at a lesser expense. The materials design process requires links between processing conditions and the resulting microstructure. We illustrate an approach to coupling the processing conditions of additive manufacturing (AM) to microstructure. A phase field model has been developed that follows the evolution of thousands of grains in three dimensions as a heat source propagates along a surface at the high rates seen during AM. Through this approach it is possible to determine the effects of the solidification conditions, the weld pool geometry, and multiple passes of the heat source on the resulting grain morphology. We also discuss a new method for determining difficult-to-measure materials parameters (data needed for design), in this case grain boundary mobilities. The mobility of grain boundaries is thought to be determined by the crystallography of the adjacent crystals. Through a direct comparison of a three-dimensional experimental movie to simulations of the evolution of 1500 grains in iron we have determined over 1600 reduced grain boundary mobilities. We find that the reduced mobilities vary by three orders of magnitude and exhibit no correlation with the boundary crystallography. This implies that factors other than crystallography set grain boundary mobilities. This brings new challenges to predicting the kinetics of grain growth in polycrystalline materials.

Ordered intermetallic precipitates are generally resistant to shearing by dislocations, resulting in strengthening, but are also effective for damage tolerance since they will ultimately deform plastically in the presence of high local stresses.  Ni-base superalloys are prototypical examples wherein L12 precipitates strengthen the solid solution nickel alloy matrix to high fractions of melting.  The contribution of precipitate shearing to overall plasticity in Ni-base alloys has to date been assessed via post-deformed transmission electron microscopy studies of mechanically deformed samples.  We report here on a novel in-situ approach to studying precipitate shearing and faulting in superalloys.   This approach integrates MEMs straining stages with a STEM detector in the SEM, enabling dynamic observations of defects and their interactions with precipitates, faults and boundaries, studied with diffraction contrast.  New insights on the frequency of shearing and the faulting mechanisms will be reported and the implications for alloy design will be discussed.     ","categories": [],

G. M. Michell, Gustave Eiffel, and more. Investigations into topology optimization of structures in the last three decades makes us wonder how optimal structures were conceived before mathematical and computational tools were available. In this talk, we begin with the ideas of Maxwell and Michell and discuss how gradient-based topology optimization is used today with a standard template of design parameterization and adjoint sensitivity analysis.   ‘Material interpolation’, which is the key idea in topology optimization, will be discussed in the context of Multiphysics problems in structures and compliant mechanisms. A few examples of both will be presented in this talk. Architects too are embracing topology optimization. A passing reference will be made to the aesthetics in structural design following the ideas of M. C. Escher.   There has been a recent surge of interest in this field due to emerging additive manufacturing. This connects topology optimization of structures to ‘metamaterial design’. A natural extension of this is simultaneous optimization of structures and materials. Towards this, the talk will conclude with ongoing efforts in the design of fiber-reinforced structures and lattice structures with anisotropy and heterogeneity to achieve optimality.

One important drawback of these steels is a continuous cyclic softening; i.e. they lose strength continuously under strain-controlled cyclic loading. This is mostly attributed to the instability of their tempered martensitic structure. To overcome this shortcoming, a small amount of highly stable nano-oxide particles can be distributed into their matrix in order to form so-called oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels. This not only improves high-temperature tensile properties and creep resistance, but also assists in mitigating undesirable cyclic softening at elevated temperatures. Another critical concern for structural materials that undergo cyclic loading is slip localization. Cyclic slip localization starts early in the fatigue life and manifests in the form of distinct dislocation structures formation such as persistent slip bands (PSBs). PSBs are typically related to the formation of extrusions and intrusions, where fatigue cracks are known nucleate. Taking two complexconcentrated alloys as materials system examples, cyclic slip localization is shown to be mitigated by altering stacking-fault energy. Furthermore, for high temperature applications, oxide dispersion strengthening is also successfully employed  ","categories": [],

The understanding of the material physics embodied by chemistryprocessing-structure-property correlation falls short due to the rapid developments in these fields. In this talk, I will discuss microstructural evolution during advanced manufacturing processes like Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Processing parameters during laser based additive manufacturing affect the fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification characteristics in the melt pool, leading to microstructural variants of texture, grain size, and morphology. A finite volume based Computational Fluid Dynamics model coupled with solidification physics has been developed to predict melting, flow, solidification, and resulting microstructural characteristics during such processes. The variation of texture, grain size and columnar/equiaxed morphology of the grains with laser power and speed has been verified against experiments. The difference in cooling curves and evolution of temperature gradients and cooling rates during solidification leading to a difference in each microstructural variant has been identified. Lower laser power and higher scan rates lead to “unconstrained” solidification with small variation of solidification times across the melt pool depth leading to finer grain structure with lower grain boundary misorientations. On the other hand, higher power and lower scan rates lead to “constrained” solidification, with huge variations in solidification times, coarser grains and highly misoriented grain boundaries. Hunt’s criterion-based processing maps for understanding the morphological variants has been prepared for systematic design of microstructure during the SLM process. In the next part, I will briefly present my work on a robust multiscale computational approach to design electrochemical materials for Solid Oxide Fuel/Electrolyzer Cells (SOF/EC). The depletion of fossil fuels and rapidly deteriorating ‘global warming’ situation with climate change has created a demand for the greener and renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Understanding the electrochemical characteristics of materials used for these technologies is the first step towards material design. The prediction of electrochemical characteristics for protonconducting Yttrium doped Barium Zirconate based SOF/EC, using a multiscale framework combining physics at the atomistic, meso, and continuum scales will be discussed. I will also talk about uncertainty quantification and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and random forest to optimize chemistry for different temperatures and atmospheres for pure/doped perovskites. These projects provide new scientific insights and demonstrate the possible application of the introduced methodology for virtual certification of the next generation of high-performance materials and manufactured products.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. R. Balamuralikrishnan   Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL)    Hyderabad     When?  21th September, 2021 (Thursday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  High performance steels deliver excellent performance for rather critical applications that have stringent, often conflicting, property requirements. Steels for naval structural applications are subject to one of the harshest operating environments, with constant exposure to sea water, various types of static and dynamic loading, and large variation in temperatures. These steels are required to possess necessary ambient temperature strength (minimum yield strength: 390 to 800MPa for different variants) and excellent low temperature impact toughness (~ 80J minimum, at minus 40o C or even minus 60o C). Apart from these, they are also expected to have good weldability and adequate corrosion resistance. For over two decades, DMRL has been actively working in the development/indigenization of low alloy steels for naval applications with yield strengths of about 400MPa to about 800MPa, which are required to have impact toughness in excess of 80J at -40o C. Our efforts have spanned the entire spectrum from lab scale scientific studies to industrial scale production and certification for final use. Given the application, large sheets/plates, in widths ranging from 1.5 to 3m, and in lengths well in excess of 6m, constitute the bulk of the requirement. Thus, while studies at lab scale involve melts of 30-50kg, industrial production involves melts of 50 tonnes or more! The talk will provide a few examples from our work spanning the entire range from the developmental phase to the industrial production phase. Special emphasis will be given to illustrating how (lab-scale) R&amp;D was employed to address challenges that arose during bulk production in order to improve product reliability and consistency     ","categories": [],
