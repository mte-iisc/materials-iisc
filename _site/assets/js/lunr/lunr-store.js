Using first-principles theoretical analysis, we predict ferroelectricity in 2-D materials like 1T-MoS2 and h-NbN, and demonstrate how it originates from strongly coupled electrons and phonons. While these allow dipolectronic devices based on ultimately thin active channels, experimental realization of such devices and their scalable fabrication are quite challenging. To this end, we report scale-free ferroelectricity in which sub-nano meter thin ferroelectric layers are naturally embedded in 2-dimensional crystalline architecture of orthorhombic structure of HfO2, a material that is already a part of current semiconductor technologies, opening up ultimately high density ferroelectric memory devices.

        "title": "Materials Design: From Grain Boundary Mobilities to Additive Manufacturing  (09/02/21)",
        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. Peter Voorhees   Frank C. Engelhart  Professor of Materials Science and Engineering   Northwestern University  Illinois, USA    When?  9th February, 2021 (Tuesday), 08:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  The classical method for designing materials to achieve certain performance goals involves a laborious procedure wherein intuition drives the design of a material that is then created and tested. In most cases, the performance goals are not achieved, and this costly procedure is repeated. By integrating data, computations, and artificial intelligence it is possible to break this expensive cycle and bring innovative new materials to the marketplace faster and at a lesser expense. The materials design process requires links between processing conditions and the resulting microstructure. We illustrate an approach to coupling the processing conditions of additive manufacturing (AM) to microstructure. A phase field model has been developed that follows the evolution of thousands of grains in three dimensions as a heat source propagates along a surface at the high rates seen during AM. Through this approach it is possible to determine the effects of the solidification conditions, the weld pool geometry, and multiple passes of the heat source on the resulting grain morphology. We also discuss a new method for determining difficult-to-measure materials parameters (data needed for design), in this case grain boundary mobilities. The mobility of grain boundaries is thought to be determined by the crystallography of the adjacent crystals. Through a direct comparison of a three-dimensional experimental movie to simulations of the evolution of 1500 grains in iron we have determined over 1600 reduced grain boundary mobilities. We find that the reduced mobilities vary by three orders of magnitude and exhibit no correlation with the boundary crystallography. This implies that factors other than crystallography set grain boundary mobilities. This brings new challenges to predicting the kinetics of grain growth in polycrystalline materials.

Ordered intermetallic precipitates are generally resistant to shearing by dislocations, resulting in strengthening, but are also effective for damage tolerance since they will ultimately deform plastically in the presence of high local stresses.  Ni-base superalloys are prototypical examples wherein L12 precipitates strengthen the solid solution nickel alloy matrix to high fractions of melting.  The contribution of precipitate shearing to overall plasticity in Ni-base alloys has to date been assessed via post-deformed transmission electron microscopy studies of mechanically deformed samples.  We report here on a novel in-situ approach to studying precipitate shearing and faulting in superalloys.   This approach integrates MEMs straining stages with a STEM detector in the SEM, enabling dynamic observations of defects and their interactions with precipitates, faults and boundaries, studied with diffraction contrast.  New insights on the frequency of shearing and the faulting mechanisms will be reported and the implications for alloy design will be discussed.     ","categories": [],

G. M. Michell, Gustave Eiffel, and more. Investigations into topology optimization of structures in the last three decades makes us wonder how optimal structures were conceived before mathematical and computational tools were available. In this talk, we begin with the ideas of Maxwell and Michell and discuss how gradient-based topology optimization is used today with a standard template of design parameterization and adjoint sensitivity analysis.   ‘Material interpolation’, which is the key idea in topology optimization, will be discussed in the context of Multiphysics problems in structures and compliant mechanisms. A few examples of both will be presented in this talk. Architects too are embracing topology optimization. A passing reference will be made to the aesthetics in structural design following the ideas of M. C. Escher.   There has been a recent surge of interest in this field due to emerging additive manufacturing. This connects topology optimization of structures to ‘metamaterial design’. A natural extension of this is simultaneous optimization of structures and materials. Towards this, the talk will conclude with ongoing efforts in the design of fiber-reinforced structures and lattice structures with anisotropy and heterogeneity to achieve optimality.

One important drawback of these steels is a continuous cyclic softening; i.e. they lose strength continuously under strain-controlled cyclic loading. This is mostly attributed to the instability of their tempered martensitic structure. To overcome this shortcoming, a small amount of highly stable nano-oxide particles can be distributed into their matrix in order to form so-called oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels. This not only improves high-temperature tensile properties and creep resistance, but also assists in mitigating undesirable cyclic softening at elevated temperatures. Another critical concern for structural materials that undergo cyclic loading is slip localization. Cyclic slip localization starts early in the fatigue life and manifests in the form of distinct dislocation structures formation such as persistent slip bands (PSBs). PSBs are typically related to the formation of extrusions and intrusions, where fatigue cracks are known nucleate. Taking two complexconcentrated alloys as materials system examples, cyclic slip localization is shown to be mitigated by altering stacking-fault energy. Furthermore, for high temperature applications, oxide dispersion strengthening is also successfully employed  ","categories": [],

The understanding of the material physics embodied by chemistryprocessing-structure-property correlation falls short due to the rapid developments in these fields. In this talk, I will discuss microstructural evolution during advanced manufacturing processes like Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Processing parameters during laser based additive manufacturing affect the fluid flow, heat transfer, and solidification characteristics in the melt pool, leading to microstructural variants of texture, grain size, and morphology. A finite volume based Computational Fluid Dynamics model coupled with solidification physics has been developed to predict melting, flow, solidification, and resulting microstructural characteristics during such processes. The variation of texture, grain size and columnar/equiaxed morphology of the grains with laser power and speed has been verified against experiments. The difference in cooling curves and evolution of temperature gradients and cooling rates during solidification leading to a difference in each microstructural variant has been identified. Lower laser power and higher scan rates lead to “unconstrained” solidification with small variation of solidification times across the melt pool depth leading to finer grain structure with lower grain boundary misorientations. On the other hand, higher power and lower scan rates lead to “constrained” solidification, with huge variations in solidification times, coarser grains and highly misoriented grain boundaries. Hunt’s criterion-based processing maps for understanding the morphological variants has been prepared for systematic design of microstructure during the SLM process. In the next part, I will briefly present my work on a robust multiscale computational approach to design electrochemical materials for Solid Oxide Fuel/Electrolyzer Cells (SOF/EC). The depletion of fossil fuels and rapidly deteriorating ‘global warming’ situation with climate change has created a demand for the greener and renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Understanding the electrochemical characteristics of materials used for these technologies is the first step towards material design. The prediction of electrochemical characteristics for protonconducting Yttrium doped Barium Zirconate based SOF/EC, using a multiscale framework combining physics at the atomistic, meso, and continuum scales will be discussed. I will also talk about uncertainty quantification and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and random forest to optimize chemistry for different temperatures and atmospheres for pure/doped perovskites. These projects provide new scientific insights and demonstrate the possible application of the introduced methodology for virtual certification of the next generation of high-performance materials and manufactured products.

        "excerpt":"Speaker and Affliation:  Dr. R. Balamuralikrishnan   Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL)   Hyderabad    When?  21th September, 2021 (Thursday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  High performance steels deliver excellent performance for rather critical applications that have stringent, often conflicting, property requirements. Steels for naval structural applications are subject to one of the harshest operating environments, with constant exposure to sea water, various types of static and dynamic loading, and large variation in temperatures. These steels are required to possess necessary ambient temperature strength (minimum yield strength: 390 to 800MPa for different variants) and excellent low temperature impact toughness (~ 80J minimum, at minus 40o C or even minus 60o C). Apart from these, they are also expected to have good weldability and adequate corrosion resistance. For over two decades, DMRL has been actively working in the development/indigenization of low alloy steels for naval applications with yield strengths of about 400MPa to about 800MPa, which are required to have impact toughness in excess of 80J at -40o C. Our efforts have spanned the entire spectrum from lab scale scientific studies to industrial scale production and certification for final use. Given the application, large sheets/plates, in widths ranging from 1.5 to 3m, and in lengths well in excess of 6m, constitute the bulk of the requirement. Thus, while studies at lab scale involve melts of 30-50kg, industrial production involves melts of 50 tonnes or more! The talk will provide a few examples from our work spanning the entire range from the developmental phase to the industrial production phase. Special emphasis will be given to illustrating how (lab-scale) R&amp;D was employed to address challenges that arose during bulk production in order to improve product reliability and consistency     ","categories": [],

Bacterial nanocellulose may prove to be one of the most promising green materials of modern times due to its advantages over plant cellulose, including high purity, good water absorption, strong water retention, high tensile strength, good biocompatibility and biodegradability Based on these characteristics, BNC has been widely used in many areas such as electronics, biomedicine, food industry and energy storage. It is also used in foods such as multifunctional food ingredients to control the properties of food or beverage as a thickener, stabilizer and texture modifier. In the biomedical field, BNC is widely studied as a highly biocompatible raw material for wound healing, artificial blood vessels, and tissue engineering. We have demonstrate by using indigenously isolated an alternative bacterium different than model organisms.

Abstract  Microstructures of materials are known to play a significant role in determining the effective properties of materials as well as their elasto-plastic response in terms of the ability to deform plastically to large strains without the onset of plastic instability and fracture. This has significance in terms of better understanding of material behavior of existing commercial alloys leading to their microstructure optimization as well as development of new alloys. Much experimental effort is being made towards developing techniques that are newer, faster, more accurate, and involve larger material volumes at smaller scales of precipitates and other constituent particles in the matrix. Additional effort is being made towards creating virtual microstructures that can efficiently and closely resemble real microstructures using statistical methods and stereological relationships. Lastly, microstructure-based finite element methodologies are being advanced to study large plastic deformation behavior of structural metallic materials for automotive forming applications. The talk would briefly review the smaller-scale particle characterization effort for structural metallic materials in the literature and then focus on the effort being made at McMaster towards (i) particle characterization of two different automotive aluminum sheet materials by statistical and FIB/SEM based experimental methods, and (ii) incorporation of particles microstructure into finite element models for studying their role in governing plastic flow, damage development, and fracture.

An aging global population is accelerating the need for better, longer-lasting implants. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to fabricate patient-specific, titanium-alloy-based implants with tailored, three-dimensional, bone-like pores and internal surfaces for forming new bone for superior integration. However, a stubborn barrier remains. Most of the implants developed by additive manufacturing technologies involve melting the materials by high energy beam, thereby increasing the operational cost for maintaining inert environment especially with reactive metals like titanium, magnesium and their alloys. In this talk, I will cover two stories, firstly, green fabrication, one the best alternative routes as there are absence of significant thermal gradients and associated stresses during printing, avoidance of solidification-induced defects, lower oxygen contamination, and lower printing cost. The second part, I will discuss the methods to improve interfacial bonding of the implants. Current line-of-sight clinical methods enhance osseointegration but can’t reach all internal surfaces of porous implants. I will present a non-line-of-sight, gas/solid-reaction-based process that is capable of generating well-controlled nanotopographies on all open (gasexposed) surfaces of these implants. Overall, this research will demonstrate simple, user friendly and cost-effective route for developing titanium implants/equivalents with enhanced interfacial bonding for load bearing functional implant applications.

Annamalai   Australian Institute for Bioengineering &amp; Nanotechnology,   The University of Queensland,    St Lucia, Queensland,    Australia, 4072    When?  3rd December, 2021 (Friday), 02:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Nanocellulose is a versatile functional nanomaterial, and it can be derived from all the lignocellulose biomass, marine animals and through bacterial engineering. It has a potential to be utilised in plethora of advance engineering applications, from both the sustainability perspectives (economy, environment and society) and new functionalities that can offer. In 2012, we have discovered that a long and thin nanofibres can be isolated from an Australian native arid grass spinifex and found that this nanocellulose can retain the cell wall constituents hemicellulose and lignin. This results in effortless fibrillation, and consequently, the cost-effective production of excellent longer and more flexible nanofibres. This unique combination opens an opportunity for tunability in residual lignocellulosic composition, morphology and the physical and mechanical properties with high product yield, through various chemical pre-treatments and surface modifications. Since the discovery, we have explored the use of spinifex nanocellulose in various applications for various industry sectors and found some limitations and challenges. This presentation will give an overview of our team’s translational research activities in clever applications including ultrathin dipped elastomer products, polymer composites, recycling papers and cementitious materials.   The presentation will also be extended on the strategies for improving sustainability and performance of rigid polyurethane foam for insulation applications, which is the research area I developed at UQ. Insulation is a cost-effective solution for saving energy in in space conditioning and appliances applications, is the need for the hour and rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) based insulation materials have gained an increased attention for their versatility, processibility and achievable physical properties (high compressive strength, low thermal conductivity) at low-density regime. Our research focuses on achieving sustainability and performance of RPUF insulation materials through systematic incorporation of biomass-derived precursors and nanomaterial additives. The presentation will demonstrate different strategies of thermal insulation and mechanical performance using palm oil (as a reactive polyol) and rod-like cellulose nanocrystals (CNC as nucleating agent), and an industrial grade lignin (as a reactive filler).

We continually interact with computational, memory, and imaging devices where a large number of electrons are pushed around various defect states at every nanosecond inside semiconductors. As these technologies are evolving rapidly from traditional circuit boards to flexible electronics, new materials, physics, and processing technologies are being explored to improve their functionality and efficiency. This brings unique experimental challenges to evaluate fundamentally the interaction of defects with electrons in novel semiconducting materials. In this presentation, I will first discuss a prototypical MIS capacitive device architecture to illustrate the electron trapping in non-volatile memory devices fabricated using low temperature processed oxide material. Unlike the conventional measurement technique, I will then describe the challenges in measuring the defects in non-conventional semiconductor materials and my approach of probing defects. In the later part, I will demonstrate a high-speed capacitance measurement system to probe the defect states in solution processed oxide materials. Finally, I will explain the major advantage of this measurement system in terms of eliminating the contribution of substrate or interface defect states. Thus new measurement system paves the way for characterizing the semiconductor materials for industrial applications.   ","categories": [],

In this regard, thermoelectric materials and devices have drawn increasing interest and attention due to their potential to convert waste heat into fruitful electricity. [1] A dimensionless figure of merit quantifies the thermoelectric material’s efficiency, zT = S 2σT/k where S, σ, T and k are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature and total thermal conductivity (sum of the electronic part, ke and the lattice part, klatt) respectively. The fact that these thermoelectric transport properties are highly interrelated throws a more significant challenge in enhancing zT. However, advances in recent times show that it is feasible to improve zT by a number of approaches: electronic band convergence, fostering resonance states near the Fermi level, quantum confinement of charge carriers, nestification, electron filtering effect, dimensionality reduction, modulating light bands with a low effective mass, deformation potential coefficient, and nanostructuring, which includes the engineering of nanoscale defects (dislocations, stacking faults, point defects, and nanopores), and multiscale hierarchical architecting, imparting rattling impurities, intrinsic bond/strong lattice anharmonicities, etc.[2] The presentation shall highlight some of these approaches that we have effectively applied on various kinds of materials, ranging from glasses and ceramics to several types of polycrystalline compounds (materials based on tellurides, sulfides, and oxides); different synthesis and processing techniques, right from traditional melt processing to advanced flash-spark plasma sintering; distinct approaches like dopant induced glass crystallization, composition engineering, nanostructuring, electronic band structure engineering, lattice softening, etc., to enhance the thermoelectric performance.[3–8] The presentation shall also touch upon our attempts to find thermoelectric materials for potential application at different operating ranges of temperature.

To control the performance of 2D materials, many methods have been proposed, including physical and chemical ways, to manipulate the electronic, atomic, and microscopic properties.

Recently, the earth-abundant semiconductor materials (binary, ternary and quaternary) have drawn major interests as viable candidate to boost the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells. Effective commercialization of solar cells hinges on the low-cost scaled up synthesis approaches along with cost-effective device fabrication techniques. Earth-abundant semiconductor materials have shown a great potential for these synthesis methods and the thin-film technology with portable deposition techniques has proven to be the most cost-effective route for solar cell fabrication. These materials have attracted substantial attention due to their non-toxicity, low-cost potential, direct band gap commensurate with optical absorption in the visible range and high absorption coefficient (&gt;104 cm-1). Thorough atomic-level insights about the fundamental properties of the interfaces and mechanisms underlying the interfacial phenomena are immensely desirable, which aids in the fabrication of high-quality and structurally ordered junctions for efficient photovoltaic applications. The understanding about the band alignment and the related properties at the interfaces is of paramount importance as it directly affects the device performance. Several of our recent studies focused on band alignment engineering for a clear understanding of the concurrent carrier transport mechanism at heterointerface. The facile synthesis, cost-effective deposition, and fundamental insights about the band-alignment provide a promising approach for fabrication of next-generation solar cells with earth-abundant light-absorbing materials.

However, high processing/annealing temperature (≥600°C) involved in the fabrication of thin/thick films causes the electrical breakdown of the films and also prevents their deposition on flexible, and metallic substrates. The thin/thick films of ferroelectrics at lower temperatures can be fabricated by (1) laser-induced crystallization (LIC) technique using an excimer laser (&lt;300oC) (2) aerosol deposition (AD) method at room temperature and (3) photon-assisted flash annealing technique. We have successfully demonstrated a way to crystallize Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (BST) thin films at a lower temperature of ~300°C by an alternating depositing and annealing process using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. At first, the BST thin film with a thickness of ~120 nm was deposited (laser energy of ~2 J/cm2) and subsequently laser annealed (66 mJ/cm2) at 300°C with several repetitions. Similarly, the aerosol deposition (AD) technique was employed to fabricate the thick films of PLZT ceramics (relaxor and anti-ferroelectric) at room temperature. The grain sizes of the AD thick films were tuned by thermal annealing which in turn can tune the electrical properties. The PLZT AD thick films showed excellent energy-storage density with stable energy efficiency which is required for commercial applications. Recently, photonics-based annealing using a xenon flash lamp has been successfully demonstrated for the annealing of metal oxide films on metal or polymer substrates fabricated by using PLD and AD. This photon-assisted flash annealing technique can be employed to realize flexible triboelectric/piezoelectric nanogenerators, magneto-mechano-electric (MME) generators, magnetic field sensors, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS), and micro-actuators.

Group,  Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Metrology (CAMM),  CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute   &amp;    Associate Professor, AcSIR (CMERI campus)   When?  20th December, 2021 (Monday), 02:30 PM (India Standard Time)   Those who are unable to attend the meeting at lecture theatre, can attend the same using the below Teams link.   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  1. Semi solid casting of Al alloys and Al matrix composites to develop prototype Automobile components    Semi solid casting (employing gravity and pressure die casting techniques) enables manufacturing of near net shaped automobile, aircraft and marine components with better mechanical and tribological properties and with better dimensional accuracy. Better strength to weight ratio of semi solid cast Aluminium alloy and Aluminium matrix composite based auto components causes reduced fuel consumption and reduced green house gas emission.  The present work discusses the development of process technology of Rheo pressure die casting (RPDC) and Rheo gravity die casting (RGDC) of Al alloys and Al matrix composites. In case of RPDC, A cooling slope made of stainless steel has been employed for semi solid slurry generation, followed by isothermal holding of the generated slurry in a resistance heating furnace and transferring it in metered quantity to the shot sleeve of high pressure die casting machine, to develop automotive knuckle housing (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra) as a prototype component out of A356 Al alloy. Whereas, Rheo gravity die casting process technology has been employed to develop light weight automobile components out of in-house developed novel Al-15Mg2Si-4.5Si composite with notably improved mechanical properties and structural integrity. Automobile Brake disc (Tata Indica) has been developed as a prototype component out of the above mentioned composite. Thereafter, the developed composite is processed using a high pressure die casting machine at liquid and semi solid state to develop prototype connecting rod (TVS), targeting two wheeler engine applications.   2. Design and Development of Tooth colored dental (Orthodontic) brackets    Dental brackets, scientifically known as orthodontic brackets, are used for correction of irregular and deformable teeth of the people by applying continuous pressure on the teeth to slowly move the teeth in a specific direction over a period of time, which helps to make proper teeth alignment. Out of the options available, ceramic brackets offer significantly better mechanical properties, increased transparency and decreased reactivity with the oral environment compared to their metallic and plastic counterparts.  In spite of costlier translucent alumina (ceramic) dental brackets available in the market, which are imported in our country, in the present work, affordable net shape Tooth coloured alumina dental brackets have been developed for a comparable cost with their metallic counterparts, employing Micro Ceramic Injection Moulding (µ-CIM) process technology, for the first time in the country. It should be noted here that, apart from processing technique, the novelty lies in the design aspect as well. Design modifications are incorporated within the developed brackets, in view of ease of manufacturing and to achieve cost efficiency. The developed brackets are found to be of low cost, tooth colored appearance, possessing improved hardness, bio compatibility and improved debonding strength. The above mentioned attributes qualifies their suitability for possible societal deployment.   ","categories": [],

RANGANATHAN Distinguished Lecture Series”   About Prof. S. Ranganathan:  Professor Srinivasa Ranganathan is the NASI Platinum Jubilee Fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore . His academic career as an educator and researcher in metallurgy at Banaras Hindu University and the Indian Institute of Science during the last four decades has been exceptional. He has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure of interfaces, quasicrystals, bulk metallic glasses, and nanostructured materials. He has co-authored three books with Alan Mackay and Eric Lord on New Geometries for New Materials, Legendary Wootz Steel with Sharada Srinivasan, and high-entropy alloys with Profs. B.S. Murty and Yeh. He worked together with metallurgical legends such as Professor T.R. Anantharaman, Prof. Alan Cottrell, and Prof Gareth Thomas. This had a profound influence on not just his life, but also on the subject of multicomponent alloys. “The search for structure continues, and I mainly rely on geometric intuition. I visited higher-dimensional space. In archaeo- metallurgy, I traveled back in time to distant lands in antiquity.”, he says in his article on “A search for structure with travels in space and time.” He is a teacher par excellence and has inspired students throughout his teaching career and changed the life of every student, who came in contact with him.   Speaker and Affliation:  Prof. J.W. Yeh  NTHU, Taiwan   When?  10th January, 2022 (Monday), 11:00 AM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Since ancient times, there has been an unbreakable myth in the manufacture of materials: it is believed that adding more kinds of alloying elements in high proportions would render the alloy brittle and useless. To break the myth, “high-entropy alloys” was proposed in 2004 and defined as having at least five major elements. The name emphasized the high entropy effect which enhances multi-principal elements in a composition to form solid solutions. Severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion and cocktail effects also accompany the alloy by affecting microstructure and properties. Now, the high entropy composition concept has been extended to ceramics, polymers and organics. Medium-entropy materials are also activated and researched. Therefore, the elemental periodic table has a new life providing unlimited compositions and properties. This talk briefly summarizes the four core effects and describes the applied technology of high- entropy materials in industry.   About the Speaker:  Prof. J.W. Yeh is a Distinguished Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. He is the first to propose the concept of HEAs and HE-related materials. He has been researching this topic for almost 19 years. From 2004 until the present, he has published more than 240 SCI papers, including at least 180 on high-entropy materials. He defined and named the new alloys; proposed four fundamental effects and established fundamental principles; extended the concept to ceramics and polymers; and paved the way for newcomers by demonstrating the feasibility, phenomena, and potential of high-entropy materials via casting, wrought, powder metallurgy, and coating routes. At ICHEM-2018, the conference’s steering committee elected him Chair of the International High Entropy Materials Consortium. Additionally, he has over 25,760 citations and an H-index of 69. (Web of science). Additionally, he holds at least 40 patents.  ","categories": [],

It is found that an increase in the Cr/Ni ratio stabilizes the topologically close-packed σ-phase and accelerates its precipitation kinetics [4], which is also enhanced by a decrease in mean grain size. By analyzing the temporal evolutions of the concentration profiles forming at FCC/σ interfaces and the dimensions of σ-phase precipitates, the diffusion processes responsible for the precipitation kinetics were identified [5]. As the σ-phase is known to cause embrittlement in austenitic alloys, its influence on tensile properties was investigated. Overall, this work not only sheds light on the factors affecting the long-term stability of HEAs from the Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni system and the precipitation kinetics of secondary phases, but it also motivates the investigation of other HEAs that are considered for applications at high temperatures.

However, it was only in the last five decades that the science of sintering was perfected. More recently, the addition of electric field-assisted sintering has led to ultrafast sintering and achieving improved properties compared to conventional sintering. In this subset of sintering processes, flash-sintering has emerged as a rather distinctive processing route due to the simplicity of the process and flexibility in scale-up. While the scientific engagement of flash sintering saw an exponential increase in the last few years, it is now being applied to processes beyond sintering. These include reactive flash-sintering, where two components are co-flashed to result in a non-equilibrium phase stabilization, the touch-free sintering, where the boundaries of electricity-induced sintering are pushed towards complex shape sintering, and the possibility of graphene infusion by flash, to name a few states of art developments in the flash. It’s speculated that most, if not all, of these distinctive properties are possible due to the existence of a solid-state plasma during the Stage III of the flash. I am looking forward to discussing these developments with you in the upcoming talk.  ","categories": [],

When?  15th April, 2022 (Friday), 04:00 PM (India Standard Time)   Location  Microsoft Teams Meet-up   Abstract  Iron is an abundant metal featured in many applications and planetary physics involving dynamic loading. Constitutive models for the flow strength as a function of strain, strain rate, pressure, and temperature are needed to model and simulate applications. This talk focuses on the behavior of iron at high strain rates using a split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar (SHPB) and at high pressures using the pressure shear plate impact (PSPI) technique. A shear-compression specimen (SCS) used to attain high strain rates, large strains, and shear dominant deformation provides a seamless characterization of a-iron over a range of strain rates, 10-4 to 2x104 s-1. In addition to the mechanical response (stress-strain), a high-speed infrared detector is used to measure in-situ temperature rise during dynamic deformation. Strong strain rate sensitivity of flow stress is observed, with strengths exceeding 1 GPa, comparable to pre-shocked iron and high strength steels. The microstructural evolution characterized using optical, SEM, TEM, and EBSD provides insights into the strengthening and deformation mechanisms.  Results from PSPI experiments on iron at pressures ranging from 10 to 43 GPa and strain rates~105 s-1 are presented. The mechanical response of the low pressure a phase (bcc) and the high-pressure e phase (hcp) is obtained, with the a to e transformation occurring at ~13 GPa. A strong pressure hardening in strength is observed, and the possible mechanisms for the hardening are discussed.   ","categories": [],
