<p>Printed electronics is a rapidly maturing field of research, where  printed, high throughput fabrication of electronic devices/ components  on various rigid/ flexible substrates are aimed at. Over the last two  decades, printing of oxide semiconductors has attracted particular  attention for their possible applications in a variety of application  domain, such as, sensors, thin film transistors (TFTs) and circuits,  photodetectors, photovoltaics etc. Although oxide semiconductors can be  very attractive choice, however, fully-printed circuits based on oxide  semiconductors have rarely been reported in the literature; one of the  major challenge here is the absence of a performance-matched high  mobility p-type (hole conducting) oxide semiconductor. In this regard,  in this PhD dissertation, the performance and capacity of printed  all-NMOS unipolar pseudo-CMOS technology based circuits are evaluated.
 At first, the deep subthreshold regime of amorphous indium-gallium zinc  oxide (a-IGZO) TFTs has been exploited to fabricate pseudo-CMOS  inverters, ring oscillators and static random access memories (SRAMs).  In this case, a composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) has been used  as the gate insulator and the individual a-IGZO TFTs have resulted in  superior device mobility values. The fabricated pseudo-CMOS design  2T-depletion type and 4T-depletion type inverters thus produced have  demonstrated an unprecedented voltage gain (Av) of 284 and 325,  respectively, at very low operating voltage of 2 V. On the other hand,  single inverters and ring oscillators have also been tested for AC  performance and found to demonstrate a switching speed up to 30 kHz.  Next, even when based on pseudo-CMOS technology, the inverters have  shown low static power consumption in the range of few hundreds of  nanowatts. While the observed results are significantly superior when  compared to the state of the art in printed electronics, it also paves  way for many applications in the portable, wearable electronics domain,  including interface circuits for sensors, displays etc.
 Next, fully-printed and further complex circuit elements have been  planned and realized using an identical low voltage operated, ele= ctrolyte-gated and a-IGZO based deep sub-threshold operable TFT technology. The TFTs have been further optimized to demonstrate  remarkably high ON/OFF current ratio as well as low subthreshold slope  near to Boltzmann’s limit (58 mV/decade) at room temperature, which is  necessary for the detection of weak biological/electrophysiological  signals that are in the µV range. Here, at first, the fabricated  pseudo-CMOS inverters with high voltage gain and noise margin are used  to fabricate common-source and differential amplifiers that can amplify  a small signal (mV range) to a large signal (Volt range) within a  suitable frequency range up to 1 kHz. Next, fully-printed circuits  consisting of amplifiers along with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)  have been realized that can interface with sensors and show the analog  to digital conversion of the input analog signal. Moreover, the entire  circuit is found capable of operating at a low supply voltage of ≤ 2 V,  and can be used for fully-printed sensor patches along with readout  electronics to detect physical, chemical or biological signals.
 Finally, an effort has been made to improve further important/ key  parameters of a TFT such as transconductance and subthreshold slope, a  new device concept, known as negative capacitance field-effect  transistor (nc-FET) has been realized. This device concept follows  completely different device architecture from conventional MOSFETs,  where the gate insulator becomes a combination of dielectric and a  ferroelectric layer placed in a series. With this combination, the  negative differential capacitance behaviour of a ferroelectric-gated TFT  can be stabilized over a large frequency range. The concepts works  similar to a step-up transformer placed inside the device that can  result in a rate of change of semiconductor surface potential to be  higher than the change in the applied gate potential, i.e. the body  factor (m) of the transistor to be less than 1 (m&lt;(&gt;«)&gt; 1). This can  translate to the sub-threshold slope of the device to be substantially  less than the Boltzmann’s limit (58 mV/decade) at room temperature. With  this device geometry, the TFTs can perform way superior in terms of  rapid switching, which would translate to enormous signal gain (η). The  total dynamic power consumption should also reduce drastically even when  all-NMOS unipolar logic is used. While, the nc-FET device concept is  novel and largely interesting, it has never been reported till date for  fully solution-processed or printed transistors. In this regard, fully  printed nc-FETs could have been demonstrated combining printed a-IGZO  semiconductor channel, Al2O3 as the dielectric PVDF-TrFE (70/30) as the  ferroelectric layer. The printed devices have shown truly  metal-insulator type transition with subthreshold slope of 2.3 mV/dec.  while the printed depletion-load type inverters have demonstrated  gigantic signal gain, as large as η= 2691, along with a few nanowatts  (nW) of dynamic power consumption. Interestingly, the nc-FETs have also  exhibited memory behaviour with capacity of holding the state of the  device for up to 10^6 seconds.</p>
