The format of the events.csv file should be as follows:
Title,Start,End,Mark,URL

Each line of the file (except the header line) corresponds to a single event.

Title: Event name.
Start: Start date and time. Date in MM/DD/YY. Time is in 12h format, e.g., "1:00 PM".
End: Same format as start. 
Mark: Marker to differentiate different events (the small colored circles) on the calendar. Options available are, "Info", "Warning", "Important", "Success", "Special", and "Blank". Choose one per type of event.
Url: Link to page containing description of event. The link has to be the full url (so e.g., http://mte-iisc.github.io/materials-iisc/<link-to-event-page>". Leave blank if it's not necessary to provide a URL.
