### Abstract:  

Low-carbon ironmaking and hydrogen metallurgy have received increasing attention globally, especially in China, Europe, and Japan, as the iron and steel industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from this industrial sector. This seminar will introduce the research on low-carbon ironmaking and hydrogen metallurgy and collaboration with the steel industry at the University of Queensland. The seminar will not only outline the research and development work jointly carried out with industrial partners in both China and Australia to address the technical issues and environmental pressures that the steel industry is facing but also exhibit a lot of opportunities for academics from a wide range of engineering fields to engage and collaborate with the steel industry in research and technology transfer in material science and engineering, low-carbon technology and hydrogen-based energy.

### About the Speaker: 
 
Professor Geoff Wang received his PhD in Metallurgical Engineering (Ironmaking and Steelmaking) from the Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1990, and then worked at Wuhan University of Science and Technology for 5 years and then for about 2 years at the University of New South Wales. He joined the University of Queensland at the end of 1996. Professor Geoff Wang has contributed over 200 journal publications, 2 patents. He has supervised many PhD students and has received many awards. His research areas are clean energy and low-carbon technologies such as pulverized coal injection into blast furnaces, modelling in ironmaking and steelmaking, hydrogen production through lower emission coal combustion, coal seam gas recovery and CO2 sequestration, and in recent years, the chemical and electrochemical conversion of CO2.
