### Abstract
<b>1. Semi solid casting of Al alloys and Al matrix composites to develop prototype Automobile components </b>
 
Semi solid casting (employing gravity and pressure die casting techniques) enables manufacturing of near net shaped automobile, aircraft and marine components with better mechanical and tribological properties and with better dimensional accuracy. Better strength to weight ratio of semi solid cast Aluminium alloy and Aluminium matrix composite based auto components causes reduced fuel consumption and reduced green house gas emission. 
The present work discusses the development of process technology of Rheo pressure die casting (RPDC) and Rheo gravity die casting (RGDC) of Al alloys and Al matrix composites. In case of RPDC, A cooling slope made of stainless steel has been employed for semi solid slurry generation, followed by isothermal holding of the generated slurry in a resistance heating furnace and transferring it in metered quantity to the shot sleeve of high pressure die casting machine, to develop automotive knuckle housing (Mahindra & Mahindra) as a prototype component out of A356 Al alloy. Whereas, Rheo gravity die casting process technology has been employed to develop light weight automobile components out of in-house developed novel Al-15Mg2Si-4.5Si composite with notably improved mechanical properties and structural integrity. Automobile Brake disc (Tata Indica) has been developed as a prototype component out of the above mentioned composite. Thereafter, the developed composite is processed using a high pressure die casting machine at liquid and semi solid state to develop prototype connecting rod (TVS), targeting two wheeler engine applications. 
 
<b>2. Design and Development of Tooth colored dental (Orthodontic) brackets </b>
 
Dental brackets, scientifically known as orthodontic brackets, are used for correction of irregular and deformable teeth of the people by applying continuous pressure on the teeth to slowly move the teeth in a specific direction over a period of time, which helps to make proper teeth alignment. Out of the options available, ceramic brackets offer significantly better mechanical properties, increased transparency and decreased reactivity with the oral environment compared to their metallic and plastic counterparts. 
In spite of costlier translucent alumina (ceramic) dental brackets available in the market, which are imported in our country, in the present work, affordable net shape Tooth coloured alumina dental brackets have been developed for a comparable cost with their metallic counterparts, employing Micro Ceramic Injection Moulding (Âµ-CIM) process technology, for the first time in the country. It should be noted here that, apart from processing technique, the novelty lies in the design aspect as well. Design modifications are incorporated within the developed brackets, in view of ease of manufacturing and to achieve cost efficiency. The developed brackets are found to be of low cost, tooth colored appearance, possessing improved hardness, bio compatibility and improved debonding strength. The above mentioned attributes qualifies their suitability for possible societal deployment.
