### Abstract
A power-law relationship between the steady state strain rate (𝜀̇) and imposed stress (σ) is well established so that the 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝜎 𝑛, at a fixed temperature, where n is termed the stress exponent. Additional microstructural terms influencing creep such as the grain size and stacking fault energy (γ) have been incorporated into the creep equation in a power-law form, such as 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝛾𝑞. In the case of an intragranular dislocation climb controlled creep in a solid solution alloy, the creep rate has been expressed as 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝐷𝜎5𝛾3, where D is the appropriate diffusion coefficient, n~5 and q~3. However, an evaluation of the earlier creep data suggests that while q~3 is reasonable for pure metals, there is considerable uncertainty in the value of q for solid solution alloys.  
 
The current study focuses on characterizing the creep behavior and the value of q for Ni – xCo alloys, with x = 10, 33, and 60, where the addition of Co reduces the stacking fault energy. All alloys are single phase solid solutions with a face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) crystal structure having a lattice parameter a ~ 0.353 nm. Prior to the creep, all alloys had a grain size d ~ 100 µm. The stacking fault energy of the Ni – 60 Co alloy was determined using a weak beam dark field technique and γ~20 mJ m-2. At a creep testing temperature of 1015 K, the stress exponent n ~ 5 for all alloys, suggesting that dislocation climb is the creep rate controlling mechanism. The cell structure observed through electron channel contrast imaging in the crept samples of the alloys is consistent with a dislocation climb mechanism. The stacking fault energy exponent q ~ 2 in Ni– (x) Co binary solid solution alloys. The difference in the q valuesfor pure metals (3) and NiCo solid solution alloys (2) may be related to the atomic misfit parameter, which needs to be considered for solid solution alloys. 
 
Subsequently, the creep behavior of single phase f.c.c. equi-atomic NiCoCr ternary, and NiCoCrFe quaternary alloys were also investigated to probe potential changes in the deformation mechanisms with the addition of alloying elements, approaching a quinary Cantor alloy. Both the ternary and quaternary alloys showed significantly lower creep rates compared to the Ni – (x) Co binary alloys. At 990 K, the stress exponent of the NiCoCr and the NiCoCrFe alloy was determined to be ~ 8 and ~ 5, respectively. Creep deformation did not cause any phase change in the NiCoCrFe alloy. Although the Ni – (x) Co alloys and NiCoCrFe alloys exhibited a similar stress exponent of n~5, the crept substructure in the NiCoCrFe alloy showed planar band features. The possible causes for the observed differences in creep behavior between the Ni-Co binary alloys and the other concentrated solid solution alloys will be discussed.
