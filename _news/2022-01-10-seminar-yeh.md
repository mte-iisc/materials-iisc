cordially invites you to the 

### First Lecture of the "PROF. S. RANGANATHAN Distinguished Lecture Series"

### About Prof. S. Ranganathan:
Professor Srinivasa Ranganathan is the NASI Platinum Jubilee Fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore . His academic career as an educator and researcher in metallurgy at Banaras Hindu University and the Indian Institute of Science during the last four decades has been exceptional. He has contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure of interfaces, quasicrystals, bulk metallic glasses, and nanostructured materials. He has co-authored three books with Alan Mackay and Eric Lord on New Geometries for New Materials, Legendary Wootz Steel with Sharada Srinivasan, and high-entropy alloys with Profs. B.S. Murty and Yeh. He worked together with metallurgical legends such as Professor T.R. Anantharaman, Prof. Alan Cottrell, and Prof Gareth Thomas. This had a profound influence on not just his life, but also on the subject of multicomponent alloys. “The search for structure continues, and I mainly rely on geometric intuition. I visited higher-dimensional space. In archaeo- metallurgy, I traveled back in time to distant lands in antiquity.”, he says in his article on “A search for structure with travels in space and time.” He is a teacher par excellence and has inspired students throughout his teaching career and changed the life of every student, who came in contact with him.

### Abstract
Since ancient times, there has been an unbreakable myth in the manufacture of materials: it is believed that adding more kinds of alloying elements in high proportions would render the alloy brittle and useless. To break the myth, “high-entropy alloys” was proposed in 2004 and defined as having at least five major elements. The name emphasized the high entropy effect which enhances multi-principal elements in a composition to form solid solutions. Severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion and cocktail effects also accompany the alloy by affecting microstructure and properties. Now, the high entropy composition concept has been extended to ceramics, polymers and organics. Medium-entropy materials are also activated and researched. Therefore, the elemental periodic table has a new life providing unlimited compositions and properties. This talk briefly summarizes the four core effects and describes the applied technology of high- entropy materials in industry.

### About the Speaker:
Prof. J.W. Yeh is a Distinguished Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C. He is the first to propose the concept of HEAs and HE-related materials. He has been researching this topic for almost 19 years. From 2004 until the present, he has published more than 240 SCI papers, including at least 180 on high-entropy materials. He defined and named the new alloys; proposed four fundamental effects and established fundamental principles; extended the concept to ceramics and polymers; and paved the way for newcomers by demonstrating the feasibility, phenomena, and potential of high-entropy materials via casting, wrought, powder metallurgy, and coating routes. At ICHEM-2018, the conference's steering committee elected him Chair of the International High Entropy Materials Consortium. Additionally, he has over 25,760 citations and an H-index of 69. (Web of science). Additionally, he holds at least 40 patents.
