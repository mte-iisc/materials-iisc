### Abstract:
The growing awareness about the carcinogenic nature and environmental toxicity of certain industrial processes (such as electrodeposition of chromium (VI) and cadmium) has encouraged research on novel eco-friendly alternatives. The widely studied alternatives for the Chromium (VI) coatings in the food packaging industry and the cadmium coatings in the aerospace industry are chromium (III) and zinc-nickel alloy coatings, respectively. While the general corrosion behaviour studied by conventional electrochemical techniques is an essential evaluation for these newly developed coatings, the focus here lies on studying the localized corrosion and hydrogen permeation behaviour of these coatings using Kelvin probe and atomic force microscopy-based techniques. The reasons behind the requirement to study localized corrosion and hydrogen permeation using these advanced techniques, and their industrial relevance for effective deployment will be discussed.
