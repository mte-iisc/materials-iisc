### Abstract
The bending of cantilevers is an alternate technique for the extraction  of power-law creep parameters of materials. It has been shown earlier  that in homogeneous systems showing tension-compression symmetry,  digital image correlation (DIC) can provide a high-throughput evaluation  of creep parameters.  Multiple stress-strain rate pairs could be  obtained from a single test in a geometry that can accommodate small  samples and simple fixturing. The present thesis attempts to extend the  usefulness of this technique to more complex systems which display large  or small-scale microstructural gradients and tension-compression  asymmetry. 
 In the first example, bending integrated with digital image correlation  (DIC) and finite element analysis (FEA) demonstrates that creep  deformation in a material primarily occurs in approximately 30% of the  cantilever volume near the fixed end, especially when the power-law  exponent ranges from 6 to 7. As an approach to minimize the amount of  material required for testing, the concept of fabricating composite  cantilevers has been proposed and validated in this study. The composite  cantilever consists of an ‘active’ creeping portion of T22 boiler steel  (2.25Cr-1Mo) and an additively extended ‘passive’ non-creeping portion  of IN-718. The reduction process involved varying the length of the T22  section, a, while keeping the total sample length, L, constant. The DIC  measurements conducted at 600 °C to assess the creep behavior revealed  that non-linear analytical expressions for cantilevers could aptly  predict the monolithic constitutive steady-state creep laws from the  composite cantilever behavior if measurements are made at a critical  distance away from the interface. FEA indicates that accurate stress  estimations enable predicting monolithic behavior using composite samp= les with smaller “a/L” ratios (e.g., 5%) also, with regions closer to the interface. Using such an approach, the creep degradation  in boiler steel that has been in service for ~ 240,000 h is ascertained  using composite cantilevers with a small volume of “active” material.  The implications of the observations for estimating the residual life of  in-service high-temperature components are discussed. 
 The second example comes from a study of the influence of  microstructurally textured regions (MTRs) in a rolled commercial  Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Such macroscopic inhomogeneities lead to long-range  strain localisation owing to the non-uniform deformation. The well-known=  tension-compression asymmetry in titanium during the c+a dislocation glide is captured using the small-scale bending of samples at  room temperature. The presence of extended \left[10\bar{1}0\right] MTRs  along the rolling direction (RD) leads to a shift in the neutral axis  towards the other half of the cantilever. Thus, the anisotropy and  asymmetry in creep are readily brought out uniquely in a single  experiment via the geometry of bending creep. In addition,  microstructure correlations have been made using polarized light  microscopy (PLM) as a high throughput method to correlate the presence  of such MTRs with the creep behaviour at room temperature. 
 Overall, these experiments serve as a foundation for the study of creep  in complex engineering material systems, such as weldments, composites,  hybrid joints, etc. and residual life assessment and structural health  monitoring.
