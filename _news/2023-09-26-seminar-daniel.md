### Abstract
Flexible electronics have been emerging in the last years for a wide variety of applications. In this scenario, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), have captured increased attention because of their complementary transport properties, and their excellent mechanical flexibility. In particular, MoS2 has shown good electron transport, while WSe2 has predominantly shown hole transport. This enables complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology with its inherent advantages over its unipolar counterpart, i.e., low power dissipation and large noise immunity. In this talk I will first present our research activities on the process technology for NMOS and PMOS FETs based on these two 2D materials. Afterwards I will show the latest results on CMOS circuits including inverter, transmission gates and pixel-matrix arrays.

### Short Bio:                                                                                                                                                                       
Daniel Neumaier received the PhD degree in 2009 from the University of Regensburg, where the research focused on quantum transport in low-dimensional semiconductors. Afterwards, he became head of the Graphene-Group at AMO GmbH, a research foundry located in Aachen, Germany, from 2009 until 2020. Since 2020 he is Full Professor for Electrical Engineering at the University of Wuppertal, heading the chair of smart sensor systems, and Scientific Advisor at AMO GmbH. His research activities focus on two-dimensional materials like graphene and MoS2 for applications in microelectronics, photonics and sensor devices. This includes more specifically the development of novel sensor systems containing the actual sensor device, readout-electronics, energy supply and wireless communication system.
