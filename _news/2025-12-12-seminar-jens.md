### Abstract:  
With classical scaling of CMOS transistors according to Dennard ́s scaling rules running out of steam, new possibilities to increase the functionality of an integrated circuit at a given footprint are becoming more and more desirable. A promising concept in this direction is to enhance the functionality of a system by maintaining the same number of individual elements.

The reconfigurable field-effect transistor (RFET) can provide such a feature, as it is an electronic device whose conduction mechanism can be reversibly reconfigured between n-type and p-type operation modes. In its most versatile variant, three independent gates are patterned over a nanoscale channel, whereby the two outer gate electrodes directly control carrier injection across the Schottky junctions at source and drain. Over the last few years, Jens and his team have focused on transferring this lab technology, originally demonstrated on silicon nanowires, to mature industrial processes and materials, with a recent demonstration of device fabrication based on the industrial 22nm FDSOI platform of GlobalFoundries. The possibility of reconfiguring those transistors makes them great candidates for novel applications, such as secure hardware computation. At the same time, the tunability of their drive current opens up novel approaches in analog circuit design. This talk provides an overview of the underlying device physics, employed integration schemes, as well as some potential target applications.
