### Abstract
For materials in impact applications, the failure processes can be a critical aspect in their impact resistance. Thus, it is desired to track the damage initiation and evolution in real time during the dynamic deformation of the specimens, which was not possible except for a few transparent materials under high-speed imaging. Over the past decade, we integrated the high-speed X-ray imaging capabilities present at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 32 ID-B (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA) with the high-rate loading offered by the Kolsky compression/tension bar and light gas gun. High-speed X-ray images and X-ray diffraction can be obtained simultaneously. The effectiveness of these new experimental capabilities is verified via impact on various material systems, demonstrating in-situ image analysis inside of the material systems during loading rates commonly encountered in high-rate deformation environments, such as high-speed machining, vehicle collision, and blast/impact.
