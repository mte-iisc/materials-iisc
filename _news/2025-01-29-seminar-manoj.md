### Abstract:  

Corrosion of materials due to their reaction with the environment has significant economic, environmental, and safety implications. It is estimated that the global cost of corrosion is approximately 3.4% of the world's GDP, highlighting the need for effective corrosion mitigation strategies. By understanding the electrochemical processes that drive corrosion, we can design materials and coatings that are more resistant to degradation. Advanced analytical techniques play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of corrosion mechanisms. Techniques such as scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) allow us to investigate corrosion processes at the macro and microscopic scales, providing valuable insights into the complex interactions between materials and their environment. Electrochemistry also plays a crucial role in understanding and developing sustainable metallurgy practices to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during the production processes.

This seminar will highlight the latest research in the field of electrochemistry and corrosion science, highlighting how these disciplines are contributing to a more sustainable future. The focus will be on the advantages of using advanced analytical techniques for corrosion research, and the complementary information they provide compared to conventional electrochemical analysis techniques. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the global challenges of corrosion and circular economy will be discussed.
