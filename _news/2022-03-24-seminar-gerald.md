### Speaker and Affliation:
Gerald Tennyson PhD<br>
Senior Scientist, TCS Research

### Brief Bio
Gerald Tennyson joined TCS Research in 2014 and at present leads the ICME-Metals (Integrated Computational Materials Engineering) group. He is responsible for applying state of the art technologies in conceptualization, design and development of computational tools specific to the metals and manufacturing industries. A mechanical engineer turned materials scientist, he obtained his doctoral degree from the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, IIT Madras with his research on understanding microstructure evolution during solidification.  His research interests are in multiscale modelling, alloy design and high performance computing.

### Abstract
The recent advances in computational tools and technologies pertaining to materials engineering, ability to deal with and leverage the vast amount of data through artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) techniques and developing closed loop iterations across these in-silico technologies with data collected through laboratory experiments and manufacturing plants provides engineers an immense opportunity to accelerate materials development and deployment in the form of engineered industrial products. This talk will focus on our experience in using some of these technologies/ approaches both in research as well as solving industrial problems. The talk will lay emphasis on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, that aims to bring a paradigm shift in accelerating materials discovery, design, development and deployment.
