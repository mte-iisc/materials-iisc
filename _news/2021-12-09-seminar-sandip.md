### Abstract
The revolutionary impact of advanced semiconducstors on our daily lives remains unabated. We continually interact with computational, memory, and imaging devices where a large number of electrons are pushed around various defect states at every nanosecond inside semiconductors. As these technologies are evolving rapidly from traditional circuit boards to flexible electronics, new materials, physics, and processing technologies are being explored to improve their functionality and efficiency. This brings unique experimental challenges to evaluate fundamentally the interaction of defects with electrons in novel semiconducting materials. In this presentation, I will first discuss a prototypical MIS capacitive device architecture to illustrate the electron trapping in non-volatile memory devices fabricated using low temperature processed oxide material. Unlike the conventional measurement technique, I will then describe the challenges in measuring the defects in non-conventional semiconductor materials and my approach of probing defects. In the later part, I will demonstrate a high-speed capacitance measurement system to probe the defect states in solution processed oxide materials. Finally, I will explain the major advantage of this measurement system in terms of eliminating the contribution of substrate or interface defect states. Thus new measurement system paves the way for characterizing the semiconductor materials for industrial applications.
