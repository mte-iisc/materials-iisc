### Abstract:
Solar-driven energy conversion systems are pivotal for sustainable growth. This talk focuses
on the main question, i.e., How to improve solar to electrical conversion efficiency of a thin
film photovoltaic device and is it possible to utilize the electrons at the surface of the
semiconducting device to drive chemical reaction such as CO2 reduction by taking advantage
of the bandgap tunability ?
I will introduce specific chalcogenide semiconductors, which are interesting due to their
bandgap tunability and potential for photovoltaics. Particularly, the case of wide bandgap
Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) semiconductor will be discussed due its favorable bandgap and
composition tuning, making it favorable for photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical (PEC)
devices. Systematic improvements in the bulk and the interface leads to enhanced efficiency
of a CIGS based PV device. The interesting surface chemistry of the CIGS makes it suitable
for PEC CO2 reduction as well. A model system demonstrating PEC CO2 reduction on direct
semiconductor-electrolyte interface will be presented.
Additionally, a brief overview of energy research activities at Energyville facility of IMEC will
be presented which includes perovskite solar cells and other activities.

### Biography:
Sudhanshu Shukla is a senior researcher at Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), Belgium.
He was also a Marie Skłodowska–Curie fellow at IMEC. He obtained his PhD from Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore in 2017. He was a visiting research scholar at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (LBNL) and the University of California, Berkeley, USA (2016). Before joining
IMEC, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Laboratory for photovoltaics at the University of
Luxembourg (2020). His research interest includes fundamental understanding and application of
novel compound semiconductors for photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical solar fuels generation.
He is leading/co-leading several European projects in this area.
