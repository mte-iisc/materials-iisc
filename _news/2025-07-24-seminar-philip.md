### Abstract:  

The study of creep deformation in structural materials has a longstanding history. Over several decades, established methodologies have emerged to extract mechanistic insights and develop predictive models based on observed mechanical behavior. This presentation critically examines three very recent publications as exemplary cases to highlight recurring limitations in conventional analytical approaches and to propose alternative frameworks for interpreting creep data.
