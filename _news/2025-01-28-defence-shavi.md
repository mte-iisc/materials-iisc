### Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the emerging technologies to  manufacture near-net-shape engineering components layer-by-layer using a  suitable heat source. The rapid adoption of AM in the field of aerospace  owes to its ability to fabricate intricate parts in one step,  sidestepping multiple processing stages, thereby reducing time, costs,  and material waste. The blend of AM with nickel-based superalloys  enables the production of intricate and durable components for the  aerospace industry. The laser powder bed fusion processing (LPBF) of  Hastelloy X serves as a prime example of this capability. While  Hastelloy X has a long-standing history in aerospace applications,  additive manufacturing represents a novel manufacturing technique. To  ensure the industrial implementation of additively manufactured  Hastelloy X, validating its viability through an extensive array of  experimental investigations is imperative. Hastelloy X, known for its  exceptional strength, oxidation resistance, and ability to withstand  high temperatures, is particularly suitable for demanding applications  in aerospace, especially in gas turbine engines. This thesis aims to  investigate the microstructural and mechanical properties of  LPBF-processed Hastelloy X to establish a correlation between different  microstructural states and their corresponding mechanical behaviours at  both room and elevated temperatures.

 The initial stage of investigation comprises the microstructural  characterization of as-built LPBF Hastelloy X. Additionally, the effect  of heat treatment processes in incrementally rising temperatures on  as-built microstructure, texture and room temperature tensile behaviour  has been explored. Elongation was found in the range of 55 -75%,  outperforming the wrought counterpart. The exceptional ductility of  heat-treated specimens was attributed to combined factors, including the  nearly full-density specimen (designed to have no cracks and minimal  porosity), the stacking fault, the dislocation-mediated plasticity  caused by the formation of microbands, and the twinning-induced  plasticity (TWIP) effect.

 Further, the elevated temperature tensile behaviour of stress-relieved  (1050°C for 1 hour) Hastelloy X ranging from 500°C to 900°C has been  investigated in detail. Moreover, the precipitation behaviour of M6C and  M23C6 carbides in the above-mentioned temperature range has also been  explored. The gradual decline in elongation was linked to the prevalence  of intergranular fracture at higher temperatures, driven by the  precipitation of carbides along the grain boundaries.

 Additionally, the effect of prolonged thermal ageing on microstructural  evolution and mechanical behaviour has been investigated. The  stress-relieved Hastelloy X underwent prolonged thermal exposure at two  distinct temperatures, namely 800°C and 950°C, each for a duration of  500 hours. This investigation aimed to elucidate the distribution and  evolution of secondary phases within the material. A comprehensive  microstructural analysis utilizing transmission electron microscopy  (TEM) revealed the development of M23C6 carbides alongside topologically  close-packed (TCP) phases such as µ, R, and P. The room temperature  tensile tests demonstrated higher yield strength and lower elongation of  the 800°C, 500 h specimen compared to the 950°C, 500 h specimen, which  was attributed to the precipitation strengthening provided by the µ  phase.

 Furthermore, creep and stress rupture behaviour of LPBF Hastelloy X have  been investigated in the stress range of 75 – 150 MPa at 800°C,  accounting for the microstructural anisotropy in two different  directions in stress-relieved conditions. The investigation reveals that  the dynamic precipitation of M6C, M23C6, σ and µ phases were found to be  the origin of threshold stress. Considering the influence of threshold  stress, the stress exponent values were estimated to be ~ 5.1 and ~ 4.5  for vertical and horizontal specimens, respectively, indicating  dislocation climb as the underlying deformation mechanism. Notably,  vertically oriented samples exhibit significantly superior creep and  stress rupture properties compared to their horizontally oriented  counterparts. This discrepancy is largely attributed to the columnar  grain morphology observed in the vertical specimens, contrasting with  the equiaxed morphology in the horizontal specimens.

 Our study concludes that the LPBF Hastelloy X is a suitable candidate  for replacing its wrought counterpart as both room and elevated  temperature properties are comparable to its wrought counterpart.
