### Abstract
The cooperative or diffusively coupled growth of multiple phases during
solidification is one of the most widely observed and generally important classes of
phase transformations in materials. Technologically, due to having lower melting
points compared with their pure components, and small freezing ranges, these alloys
have excellent fluidity exhibited during casting and favorable properties offered by
the fine composite structures both of which contribute to the wide application of
eutectic alloys in the casting, welding, soldering, and additive manufacturing of
engineered components. Academically, the topic of eutectic solidification offers a
wealth of rich problems involving multicomponent thermodynamics, solid-liquid and
solid-solid interfacial phenomena, morphological stability, chemical and thermal
diffusion, and nucleation phenomena. Surprisingly, despite the broad-based
technological and academic importance, many fundamental questions regarding
eutectic solidification remain unanswered. This lack of understanding severely limits
our ability to employ computational methods in the prediction of microstructure for
the effective design of new materials and processing techniques through simulation.

In this study, we address critical questions regarding microstructure selection in
three-phase eutectic systems in the presence of crystal/crystal anisotropy. Real-time
directional solidification and rotating directional solidification experiments were
performed on In-Bi-Sn model alloy to characterize different grain types in three-phase
systems. It is shown that while lamellar ABAC pattern is preserved during RDS of an
isotropic eutectic grain, both the phase arrangement and the morphologies of phases
could be altered in the presence of interphase boundary anisotropy. Diverse classes of
three-phase eutectic grains are identified and analyzed. It is shown that the formation
of these grains is a function of the intrinsic properties of the interphase boundaries,
rather than experimental parameters. The equilibrium shapes of the interphase
boundaries are experimentally determined and consequently, the corresponding Î³-
plots of the interphase boundaries are constructed. These results are significant not
only for the materials science community but also for the out of equilibrium pattern
formation dynamics branch of nonlinear physics.
