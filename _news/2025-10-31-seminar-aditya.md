### Abstract:  
Topologically closed-packed (TCP) phases are complex intermetallic phases that often precipitate in and can significantly influence the mechanical behavior of a wide range of engineering alloys, ranging from superalloys and steels to high-entropy alloys (HEAs). While certain effects of TCP phases have been reported in the past, generally in terms of strengthening or embrittling, other vital aspects are usually ignored, namely matrix compositional change, associated temperature-intrinsic property variation, particle damage accumulation, etc. More importantly, the evaluation of strength or ductility itself is generally not carried out in a quantitatively transferable way. In the present talk, our recent efforts to disentangle multiple, often competing effects in mechanical behavior, originating from a TCP phase, will be presented. A model HEA composition from the CrMnFeCoNi system, with a consistent initial microstructure, is used to determine the effects of a TCP phase (presently the Ïƒ-phase). This will be described through the interaction between precipitates and the matrix, their impact on strength and work-hardening, and how these differ at different temperatures, as evaluated through tensile testing. The result offer insights into the interplay between TCP content, solute depletion, intrinsic strength, twinning ability, to name a few. Based on the rigor and the relatively large number of mechanical tests, we consider this to be the first view on quantitatively transferrable evaluation of TCP phase in a structural alloy.
