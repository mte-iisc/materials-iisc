### Abstract
With increasing environmental and ecological concerns due to the use of petroleum based chemicals and products, the synthesis of fine chemicals and functional materials from natural resources are of great importance. Bacterial nanocellulose may prove to be one of the most promising green materials of modern times due to its advantages over plant cellulose, including high purity, good water absorption, strong water retention, high tensile strength, good biocompatibility and biodegradability Based on these characteristics, BNC has been widely used in many areas such as electronics, biomedicine, food industry and energy storage. It is also used in foods such as multifunctional food ingredients to control the properties of food or beverage as a thickener, stabilizer and texture modifier. In the biomedical field, BNC is widely studied as a highly biocompatible raw material for wound healing, artificial blood vessels, and tissue engineering. We have demonstrate by using indigenously isolated an alternative bacterium different than model organisms. Further an efficient BNC synthesizing strain-using glycerol as a low- cost carbon source confirming the economic feasibility of BNC production. The structural characteristics of the BC membrane produced by glycerol were found to be more suitable for various medical applications. <br>
