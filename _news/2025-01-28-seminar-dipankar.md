### Abstract:  

As aberration-corrected ultra-high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, as well as 4D STEM techniques, become commonplace, it is sometimes useful to remind ourselves of what could be done with electron microscopy techniques with far less expensive instrumentation. We, therefore, explore the basis of structure determination by convergent beam electron diffraction and describe how channelling enhanced microanalysis can be used to determine elemental site occupation in a crystal lattice with examples. 
 

### About the Speaker: 
 
Prof. Banerjee received his BTech degree from IIT Madras in 1974 and his PhD from The Indian Institute of Science in1979. He led the Electron Microscopy and Titanium Alloy groups as a scientist in the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). He was the Director of DMRL from 1996-2002 and provided leadership for many critical defence related materials programs including special naval steels for the Indian Navy’s aircraft carriers, investment casting processes for single crystal, directionally solidified and equiaxed Ni base alloys and the development of titanium alloys products for aeroengines. As Chief Controller R&D of DRDO’s aeronautics and materials programmes from 2002-2010, he coordinated military engine and combat aircraft programmes, and major system development efforts in airborne electronic warfare, unmanned vehicle and airborne early warning capabilities. He also conceptualized new materials programmes for application at ultra-high temperature, stealth, and electronic devices. After he joined the Materials Engineering Department of The Indian Institute of Science in 2010, he coordinated the activities of the Advanced Facility for Microscopy and Microanalsyis (AFMM) and was responsible for major funding inputs into this centre. He is currently an Emeritus Professor and leads a research group in the Department of Materials Engineering in the Indian Institute of Science that focuses on constructing quantitative and predictive understanding of the phenomena underlying the materials development and application effort, with an emphasis on engineering materials. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, the Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar Award in Engineering Sciences and is a fellow of all the Indian Science and Engineering Academies. He has been recognised as a Distinguished Alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and the Indian Institute of Science.
