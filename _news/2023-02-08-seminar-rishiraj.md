### Abstract 
The phenomenon of flash sintering discovered in Boulder in 2010 is expanding into new fundamental directions. One of them is the view that the flash "transition" exemplified by superdiffusion, a transition to electronic conductivity in oxides, volume expansion and evidence of defect generation, is most likely a phase transition. Fundamental studies of such a hypothesis are enabled by recent work on flash sintering of metals, e. g. copper. Among many applications one significant development is the production of graphene-infused copper with a conductivity that is higher than that of the copper it is made from*. A full analysis suggests that the conductivity of the composite is greater than predicted by the rule of mixtures, raising fresh questions about the presence of space charge at the graphene-copper interface produced by flash.
