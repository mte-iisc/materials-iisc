### Abstract:  
Additively manufactured (AM) Ni-base superalloys are emerging field of interest due to low production cost, less lead time, less wastage of materials, and intricate geometry fabrication. Therefore, in this research work, the γʹ precipitate coarsening kinetics in IN738LC Ni-base superalloy made by laser-powder bed fusion were predicted by one-dimensional mean field modeling and compared with the experimentally measured rate. A good agreement was observed between the predicted rate and the measured rate. It is found that during the initial stage of aging, the precipitate coarsening rate is faster for the AM superalloy compared to the superalloy having an equilibrium composition of phases. Therefore, the transition time from bimodal to unimodal distribution of precipitates is found to be much less compared to the conventionally cast superalloy. However, the steady state coarsening rate is the same for the superalloy made by both methods.
