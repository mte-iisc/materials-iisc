### Abstract: 
Multi-element hard coatings inspired by high entropy alloys offer a way to explore the hardness-toughness tradeoff in materials science. In this talk, I will present sputter deposited (Hf-Nb-Ta-Zr)C as a promising material to obtain super hardness and respectable toughness. Extensive microstructural and mechanical characterization was performed to understand the specific roles of microstructure and residual stress on the fracture behaviour. A combination of nanoindentation and in situ microcantilever toughness testing quantitatively reveals the relationship between apparent and true toughness of hard coatings.
