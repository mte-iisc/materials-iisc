### Abstract
The demand for organ transplantation and the need to develop effective  disease models for drug testing have encouraged significant progress in  tissue engineering. Developing scaffolds that can accurately mimic the  complex physiology of human tissues is crucial. Among the various  fabrication methods, 3D bioprinting has emerged as a revolutionary  technique capable of creating intricate structures by precisely  depositing cells within a matrix of biomaterials. Various biomaterials  such as gelatin, alginate, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and agarose have  been utilized to fabricate bioinks owing to their properties that  support tissue growth and organization. However, these materials often  fail to meet the diverse mechanical and biophysical requirements of  different tissues, and there is a growing need for polymers that offer  additional biomedically beneficial properties, such as inherent  anti-biofouling capabilities. Thus highlighting the necessity for  further exploration of suitable biomaterials.

 In addressing these challenges, our study explores mucin as a bioink  material. Mucin, a glycoprotein found abundantly in mucus that lines  mucosal surfaces, possesses unique hydrogel properties. Beyond its role  in hydration, lubrication, and forming protective barriers, mucin  exhibits complex biochemical structures that facilitate chemical  modifications. Despite these advantages, mucins are relatively  underexplored in the field of 3D bioprinting.

 In our research, we synthesized a mucin-based bioink and evaluated its  rheological behavior, printability, and compatibility with cells. By  modifying mucin with methacrylic anhydride (MA), we synthesized a  photocrosslinkable derivative methecrylated mucin (MuMA). Using lithium  phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) as a visible light (405  nm) photoinitiator, we ensured cell safety compared to UV-induced  crosslinking methods used in other bioinks. This approach highlights  mucin's versatility and potential as a bioink material, offering a  pathway to develop advanced tissue engineering constructs that meet the  diverse needs of biomedical applications.

 In our initial work, to create a bioink with optimum viscosity, we  combined MuMA with bare mucin. The inherent inter- and intra-molecular  interactions facilitated the physical crosslinking between the MuMA and  mucin. The bioink demonstrates favorable rheological, gelation, and  structural properties when crosslinked. It exhibits shear thinning  behavior, ensuring cell safety during printing, while its EGF-like  domains, rich in cysteine, facilitate the growth, migration, and  differentiation of fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. The printed scaffolds  feature optimal swelling and degradation properties, with a pore size of  <(><<)>100 Âµm, promoting the migration and proliferation of NIH3T3  cells. Varying the crosslinking time provides insights into the  properties of the 3D-printed scaffolds. An increase in cell numbers  after 21 days indicates the matrix's cell-supportive nature. Our  findings demonstrate that mucin-based bioink promises a significant  advancement toward expanding the repertoire of bioinks available for 3D  bioprinting and tissue engineering.
 In order to improve the properties of the bioink further, we have  combined hyaluronic acid (HA) and MuMA to be used for lung tissue  engineering. HA, a crucial extracellular matrix component, is  mucoadhesive and enhances ink viscosity and printability. Rheological  tests reveal shear-thinning behavior, aiding cell protection during  printing and improved MuMA bioink viscosity by adding HA. The printed  structures exhibited porous behavior conducive to nutrient transport and  cell migration. After four weeks in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the  scaffolds retain 70% of their mass, highlighting stability.  Biocompatibility tests with lung epithelial cells (L-132) confirm cell  attachment and growth, suggesting suitability for lung tissue  engineering.

 In the following study, for cartilage tissue engineering, ionically  crosslinkable alginate was incorporated into the MuMA bioink, forming a  double crosslinked interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel bioink.  Furthermore, HA, naturally occurring in cartilage and synovial fluid,  was introduced to enhance scaffold characteristics. HA has been shown to  improve cartilage lubrication, regulate inflammation, promote cell  proliferation, and enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and  regeneration, proving beneficial in cartilage tissue engineering. The  study demonstrated that double crosslinked scaffolds made of MuMA,  alginate, and HA exhibited compressive moduli similar to native  cartilage, contrasting with single crosslinked counterparts. Degradation  profile, water uptake, and porosity were also influenced by double  crosslinking, ensuring scaffold durability and stability to support  chondrocytes. Biocompatibility tests with C28/I2 cells and collagen type  II profiling suggest the chondrogenesis and cell-supportive nature of  the bioink. This study proves mucin to be a versatile material for  tailored cartilage tissue engineering applications.

 Our study concludes that mucin demonstrates promising potential as a  bioink material that can be customized to suit specific applications,  thus broadening the spectrum of available bioinks.
