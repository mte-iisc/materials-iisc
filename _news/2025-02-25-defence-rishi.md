### Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates are currently used in  commercial aircrafts replacing their metallic counterparts. Epoxy is  used as matrix in CFRPs in the primary structures of aircrafts such as  fuselage, wings and tail parts, due to its superior properties. However,  there are many disadvantages in CF/Epoxy laminates such as, slow  production rate due to curing, lack of recyclability, brittleness, and  susceptibility to catastrophic failure. Additionally, epoxy requires  rivets for joining, have a limited pot life, and pose challenges in  damage repair. Their sensitivity to high temperatures also restricts  their use in applications near engine components. To overcome these  problems, high temperature thermoplastics such as PEEK can be used  instead of epoxy as matrix. It does not require curing and the presence  of phenyl groups in the main backbone chain provides high strength,  thermal stability and rigidity to the polymer, and it can be used at  high temperatures (150-200oC) for prolonged time without losing  structural integrity. However, the surface energy of CF and PEEK are  very different. The lack of functional groups and smooth surface of CF  increases the difficulty in wetting of PEEK over CF. The poor interface  between PEEK and CF will give rise to poor mechanical properties such as=  interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), Flexural strength (FS), fracture toughness etc. This work endeavors to achieve good mechanical  properties as well as functional properties such as, deicing and  electromagnetic shielding, in CF/PEEK laminates.

 Chapter 1 is introduction giving a holistic view of thermoplastic based  laminates in aerostructures. Current challenges in CF/Epoxy laminates  and state-of-the-art literature, which provides approaches to overcome  those challenges. It also discusses the outlook and perspective of the  literature review, and the objectives of the thesis.

 Chapter 2 contains information about the materials experimental  techniques and characterization methods used in the thesis.

 Chapter 3 aims to optimize the processing parameters, pressure,  temperature and residence time, in compression molding to produce CF= /PEEK laminates. The results show that 410oC temperature, 5+10+15+20 MPa pressure cycle and 30 minutes at each pressure produced  the best laminate with 66 MPa ILSS and 658 MPa FS, which are much  superior to the commercial CF/Epoxy laminates currently being used. The  deicing time was 120 s in electrothermal heating at 2V to melt frozen  droplets of 10 Î¼L water and EMI shielding effectiveness was 47.5 dB.

 Chapter 4 aims to improve the deicing and EMI shielding performance by  incorporating stainless steel (SS) mesh at the top and bottom of the  CF/PEEK laminate. To improve the bonding with PEEK matrix SS mesh was  coated with Polyetherimide (PEI). ILSS, FS and storage modulus showed an  improvement of 9%, 16% and 44% after the incorporation of PEI coated SS  mesh. The deicing time was reduced from 120 s to 45 s. EMI shielding  effectiveness also improved from 47.5 dB to 60 dB. The dominant  mechanism of EMI shielding changed from absorption to reflection.

 Chapter 5 aims to improve Mode I fracture toughness (GIC) and ILSS by  electrospraying graphene oxide (GO) and then growing ZnO nanorods by  SILAR technique on CF surface. GIC and ILSS showed an increase of 19%  and 13% for ZnO+GO-CF/PEEK laminates. The SEM fractographs showed the  interfacial debonding was suppressed and the major mode of failure  changed to matrix deformation. A minor increment in EMI shielding  effectiveness was also observed from 47.5 dB to 49 dB.

 Chapter 6 explores the shockwave damage of the neat CF/PEEK laminates  and ZnO+GO-CF/PEEK laminates. The damaged laminates were then healed  using appropriate temperature and pressure to recover the loss in  mechanical properties. The neat CF/PEEK laminate lost 35% and 66% ILSS  at 367 bar and 545 bar damaging pressure, whereas these losses were 29%  and 37% for ZnO+GO-CF/PEEK laminate. After the healing treatment, the  neat CF/PEEK laminate recovered 100% and 74% of original ILSS value at  367 bar and 545 bar respectively, whereas these values were 82% and 75%  for ZnO+GO-CF/PEEK laminate. Thus, the interfacial strengthening by  ZnO+GO reduced the damage. However, the recovery is similar because the  broken ZnO or GO nanoparticles could not be repaired by healing  treatment.

 In summary, this thesis contributes to enhance the current knowledge on  improving the important structural and functional properties of CF/PEEK  laminates, which is highly desirable as an aerostructure material in the  current scenario. It also explores the damage aspects and recovering the  properties after damage.
