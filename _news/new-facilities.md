Check out the new facilities

K.P. Abraham Memorial Fund was launched in 2012 with a goal of raising Rs. 2 crores to serve the twin objectives of equipping our new building (see below), and endowing a visiting faculty chair. We have already received generous contributions from our alumni and well wishers. This drive will remain open until the goal is reached.

The Department has over nearly 110 PhD scholars, and about 30 masters students, It also runs, together with the Materials Research Centre, the Materials Stream in the Institute undergraduate program; three batches (2015, 2016, 2017) of students have graduated, and joined the Materials community so far.
