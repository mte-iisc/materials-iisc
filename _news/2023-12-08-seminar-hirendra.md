### Abstract:
Metal chalcogenides are the potential competitors to traditional crystalline silicon solar
cells owing to their unique properties such as high abundance, high absorption
coefficients (104
-105 cm-1), tunable bandgap, cost-effectiveness, and robust stability.
However, their performance is constrained by challenges such as rapid recombination
of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and inadequate band edge potentials. To
address these limitations, p-n heterojunctions, where a high-bandgap n-type
semiconductor is combined with a low-bandgap p-type semiconductor, have emerged
as a highly promising approach. This approach facilitates the creation of reliable and
efficient photonic devices capable of harnessing a broader spectrum of solar radiation.
These junctions serve as the main active sites for efficient charge transfer processes,
ensuring rapid separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers due to the
built-in electric field. Furthermore, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
optical and material properties of these heterojunction systems, it is imperative to
investigate the ultrafast processes involved such as charge transfer, trapping, and
relaxation dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes. To this end, femtosecond
transient absorption spectroscopy has been employed as a valuable tool. We have
investigated the charge transfer dynamics at the interface of p-type copper, antimony,
tin chalcogenides (Cu2ZnSnX4, CuX, SnX, Sb2X3, CuInX2: X=S, Se,) and n-type
cadmium chalcogenides (CdX, X=S, Se) which is widely used in solar cell technology
and photocatalysis. By probing into these ultrafast processes, research efforts aim to
unlock opportunities for the development of highly efficient photovoltaic and
photocatalytic devices, thereby contributing to the mitigation of energy and
environmental challenges.
