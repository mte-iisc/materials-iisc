### Abstract
Corrosion is a phenomenon that affects metals and metallic alloys in different ways depending upon the environmental conditions. Corrosion science and engineering is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor that involves knowledge and expertise in a broad range of diverse fields. In this talk, I will outline how economics, history, chemistry, electrochemistry, electronics, metallurgy and materials science all play a role in motivating, informing, understanding, quantifying and dealing with corrosion. Forms of corrosion and materials selection will be included as time permits. Examples will be provided to illustrate concepts.
