### Abstract:  

It is known that India is participating in several International mega Science and Technology projects with real resource commitments such as the CERN-India collaboration in Geneva, Switzerland, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in Cadarache, France, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) in Hawaii, USA, The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) and many others. One often hears whether India can afford such "luxuries". In this lecture, I try to convince the audience that these investments in a few, carefully chosen, big Science and Technology projects are not only justified but are also important for our country’s future.

### Speaker Bio :

Prof Ramamurthy is a well-known Indian nuclear scientist with a broad range of contributions from basic research to science administration. Prof Ramamurthy started his career in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai in the year 1963. He has made important research contributions, both experimental and theoretical, in many areas of nuclear fission and heavy ion reaction mechanisms, statistical and thermodynamic properties of nuclei, physics of atomic and molecular clusters and low energy accelerator applications. During the period 1995-2006, Prof Ramamurthy was fully involved in science promotion in India as Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Science & Technology (DST), New Delhi.

Prof Ramamurthy was also the Chairman of the IAEA Standing Advisory Group on Nuclear Applications for nearly a decade. After retirement from government service, Prof Ramamurthy, in addition to continuing research in Nuclear Physics in the Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi, has also been actively involved in human resource development in all aspects of nuclear research and applications. Prof Ramamurthy is also a Chairman, Recruitment and Assessment Board, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Member, National Security Advisory Board. In recognition of his services to the growth of Science and Technology in the country, Prof Ramamurthy was awarded one of the top civilian awards of the country, the Padma Bhushan, by the Government of India in 2005.
