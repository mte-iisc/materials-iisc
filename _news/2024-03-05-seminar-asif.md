### Abstract
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven marvels relies heavily on the continuous advancements in digital memory and storage technologies, particularly dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and NAND flash. However, the trajectory of exponential improvements in these technologies is facing formidable challenges. In this talk, we will discuss the potential of the emerging ferroelectric technologies to upend the memory and storage landscapes. We will explore the prospects and challenges of using ferroelectrics to the transition from 2-D to 3-D in DRAM technology, as well as their role in facilitating vertical scaling in NAND technology, with the goal of achieving the 1000-layer milestone and beyond. We will also show that interface defects present an inevitable dilemma for FEFETs – trapped charges at the interfaces are crucial for facilitating low-voltage polarization switching. We will subsequently demonstrate that interface defects can be engineered to enhance FEFET performance. We will also delve into the outlook for ferroelectric-based embedded memories, which are particularly crucial for AI workloads.
