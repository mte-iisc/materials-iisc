### Abstract
Halide activated pack cementation is a versatile and economical process of surface modification applicable to a broad range of metallic substrates, with nickel and iron-based alloys being the most common. The alloy surfaces can be engineered for resistance to corrosion, wear, erosion, etc., for service in demanding environments, e.g., those involving high temperature oxidation, accelerated corrosion under fused salt films, etc. If the fundamentals are well understood, the coating process can be controlled to obtain the desired final composition and microstructure. The in -situ generation of halide vapor species inside the pack with subsequent transport, surface reactions and solid-state diffusion are all important phenomena that need attention to achieve optimal coating conditions. In this talk, I will review the halide-activated pack cementation process; discuss relevant thermodynamics and kinetics, and present examples from our work.
