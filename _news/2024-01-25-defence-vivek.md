### Abstract
Near β and metastable β-titanium alloys are difficult to process due to  narrow processing window. Lower processing temperature causes difficulty  in recrystallization of these alloys especially in two-phase conditions.  However, processing in this regime is important for achieving  microstructural control for the desired mechanical properties.  Furthermore, most of the studies in this field are either in single  phase β or about the globularization behavior of mostly α-laths in the  (α+β) regions. Hence, there is dearth of information on the  microstructural state and role of the β-phase during deformation in  these conditions. Therefore, aim of the present investigation is to  address the gaps in literature pertaining to recrystallization behavior  of α and β phases during hot deformation of near β - and metastable β-  titanium alloys in (α+β) phase field.
 To achieve the above-mentioned goals in the present work, a metastable β  titanium alloy, Ti10V-2Fe-3Al, and a near β titanium alloy, SP-700, both  with lamellar starting microstructure, have been subjected to uniaxial  compression tests in (α+β) regions as function of temperature and strain  rate to optimize the primary processing conditions. Subsequently, the  alloys were hot rolled up to 90 pct. in the (α+β) region followed by  static annealing as a function of temperature and time to elucidate the  microstructural and textural evolution in finally processed condition.  In these conditions, the most relevant properties were evaluated for the  two alloys, namely, fatigue crack growth (FCG) for Ti-10-2-3 alloy and,  superplastic behaviour for the SP-700 alloy.
 While kinking and bending is the dominat mechanism in globularization of  α phase; grains are formed through CDRX mechanism in the β-phase for  both the alloys at lower temperature and at lower strain rate. The best  processing conditions were identified that led to DRX of α and β phases  through the strain rate sensitivity maps, for both the alloys.  Signatures of the deformation texture were observed in the α and β  phases of both the alloys in all the annealed conditions. Grain boundary  sliding was found to be one of the dominant deformation mechanisms  during superplastic testing of the SP-700 alloy.
