### Abstract:  
In Ni-based superalloys, coherent annealing twin boundaries (ATBs)—traditionally regarded as low-energy, inert interfaces—can undergo localized phase transformations that drive precipitate evolution. Using state-of-the-art multi-scale characterization, we directly reveal that these nominally benign boundaries become hotspots for coherent precipitate evolution. Moreover, this unexpected interfacial precipitation is accompanied by adjacent precipitate-free zones that promote intense strain localization under mechanical loading, ultimately leading to premature failure near the twin boundaries. These findings challenge the conventional perception of twin boundaries as benign, static features and provide a mechanistic understanding of how atomic-scale interface evolution can undermine macroscale alloy integrity. Finally, ongoing work extending these insights to environmental degradation (oxidation) along grain boundaries in adjacent structural alloys will also be discussed, underscoring the broader implications of interface-driven transformations for alloy performance.
