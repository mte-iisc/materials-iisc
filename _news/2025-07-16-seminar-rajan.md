### Abstract:  
Robustness and reliability of electronic systems used as part of green transition technologies are challenged today due to several corrosion failure mechanisms caused by harsh environmental conditions. These conditions include climatic exposure such as humidity and temperature variations and other atmospheric pollutants. For some applications, exposure conditions can be as severe as offshore. Sustainable electrical energy production, conversion, and use is most important today as part of renewable energy, E-mobility, information technology and for other technological sectors. Efficiently functioning electronics systems are key to attaining this goal, while they are used under broader service boundaries as part of various technologies.

This talk provides an overview of our center research activities on corrosion of electronics, especially for power electronics devices and systems due to exposure to harsh environmental conditions. The talk will detail our work investigating on failure mechanisms, mechanistic and AI-Analytics based modelling, and importance of the issue in connection with the use of electronics in green transition technologies such as renewable energy, e-mobility etc.
