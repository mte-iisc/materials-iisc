### Abstract
An increasing demand for data generation, storage, and intelligence generation from data is driving advances in memory technology and advanced computing applications. Memory performance is starting to define modern day computing in both mobile and server environments. There is an absolute need to continue the tremendous pace of memory technology improvements to deliver performance gains while managing the associated economics of scaling. In this discussion, we present the current status of primary memory technology (DRAM and NAND) and their scaling path while highlighting the importance of emerging memory options – their shortcomings and advantages. We will also discuss the economics of scaling and need for continued innovation in memory technology and system enablement to deliver to diverse end application requirements.
