<p>Welcome to the Department of Materials Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science. Earlier, we were Department of Metallurgy - the oldest such department in southern part of India. While you take a virtual tour of our past, present and vision by browsing through the links, we have also put together information about current and prospective students as well as faculty, and the mechanisms through which we interact with industries.
